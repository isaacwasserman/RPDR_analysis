 - Ah!
 - I'm making, like, a little bit of pain, like, real pretty.
 - Money.
 - It's a heavy load to be doing four costumes.
 And the ideas I pitched out first weren't taken in,
 so I had to take their lead and do what they want,
 and we're on a time schedule,
 so that seems to be kind of crazy.
 - Cut them.
 - 'Cause the caves we could make a necklace, right?
 Or on our neck.
 And then we could have the cape that attacked
 just in the back.
 - That's cute.
 - I can get jiggy, I can get jiggy and wiggy.
 These aren't the kind of songs I like to do, I'm sorry.
 - I have a nightmare.
 - And I didn't wake up.
 - We don't, she's my leader, she's slamming me down.
 - Yes.
 - I really don't like this kind of edge of competing.
 It's weird, and I don't like being here.
 - Who loves her?
 - I don't know where the confusion comes from.
 I'm just a different person from everybody else,
 and I'm on Planet Nine, they're on Planet Three.
 It's design.
 - Oh, I am taking charge.
 I got that one.
 - Oh, look at that.
 - I don't know what they're just about.
 - This one's yours.
 - This one's mine.
 - It's very short, isn't it?
 - It is short, but sometimes I can get short, too.
 People don't know that.
 - My biggest fear is my anxiety.
 - Oh, see you later in the magazines.
 (laughing)
 - It's just it's time to go.
 I don't need to be in this anymore.
 Riding this roller coaster.
 - Thank you.
 - Oh, goodness.
 - I'm going forward, I'm not stopping.
 This is another stepping zone.
 I'm gonna make it, I'm not worried about that.
 The reason I was chosen last
 is because Akasha fully didn't feel comfortable with me,
 and I think people don't know how to understand my character.
 - Okay, all right.
 - That's why it's a challenge, Tammy.
 - Well, when I was not just...
 - I wish that I could have been a little more loose.
 - Oh, just because I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
 - I did what I did.
 - Well, it can be a costume, right?
 And you don't have to actually sew them,
 you take them like this, and you knot them together.
 - Costumes are, are they telling you what to do?
 - Well, I'm a little worker girl.
 - One. - Real simple.
 - One. - Two.
 - No, no, no, it's a role.
 - I'm really not in tuning in to the songs,
 but I'm as an entertainer, I'm gonna do my best.
 - Oh. - My ear is not even,
 it's not even in my ear.
 - We're called the Golden Holes.
 - She's yelping.
 - Well, we never know.
 - A lot tougher.
 - If I had the song down, it would have been better,
 but I didn't have the song down.
 And I had made the decision before I went on stage today
 that I was gonna not do that song if it happened to me.
 - Just that.
 I think we should do one skirt.
 - That really hurt, like I was third wheel.
 Felt like being back in high school, perhaps.
 It's not like I'm some amateur, really, really sucked.
 - You shouldn't act too frustrated.
 - I'm not acting too frustrated.
 - If y'all would just listen to what I have to say,
 then it'd be easier for me.
 But you're telling me what to do, you're directing me,
 and I can't, you know, a lot?
 - Okay.
 - Finished.
 That's the panel.
 - If we had capes on, right?
 With the brown.
 And it's just slamming my ideas down.
 - Yes, in this room.
 - Did you take this in?
 - I'm gonna take it in again.
 - African cherry.
 - Don't look like this in this chat, right?
 - Yeah, that's the point.
 - Akasha is the director.
 Akasha is the producer.
 Akasha is in charge of the group.
 And we switch it around.
 Akasha is the director.
 Akasha is the producer.
 She's Beyonce.
 - This just makes me angry, you know.
 I'm tired, too.
 It makes me angry.
 It was hard, I knew it was gonna be hard for me.
 No, I'm not having the best of the day,
