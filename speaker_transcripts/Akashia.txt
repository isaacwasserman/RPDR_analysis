 - Wait a second, or two?
 - Actually, he put that in there.
 - Then he didn't win, and he's judging us.
 - He do.
 - Oh, I was so shocked.
 Her shoes were sickening, her dress was amazing.
 She was just so small and petite, and she was so sweet.
 My talent used to realize I'm my shocked value.
 - I love the attention.
 I do.
 I love it, crave it.
 - Chanel has a lot of experience,
 but she can come across as a little bit arrogant.
 - The thing is that if everybody has something to say
 about what each and every one of us has to do,
 they create activity, it shuts down.
 - Yeah, I agree.
 - There is no way to work with it.
 We need to trust each other.
 - No.
 - No.
 - No cutouts for me.
 - Don't think that I deserve to be the top ho,
 but I know my office not bad enough to be in the bottom.
 - Right.
 - From the beginning.
 - No, no, no.
 - I'm going to put myself into the choreography
 and let it shine.
 That's what I'm gonna do.
 I can't speak for the others.
 - I choose Jake.
 - It's quite and simple.
 - I slipped.
 - Yes, on the ground, I was on the floor.
 - I'm not sure how following on the runway
 will affect my chances.
 I hope I'm still.
 - Thank you for this chance.
 It was an honor.
 - Tammy at Awkward Spontaneous Time
 says the things where I have no clue where she comes up with.
 - Thank you, I'm coming, my little--
 - Impersonation.
 - We're about to rediscover.
 - They're all the same practically.
 - I wasn't charging, working on the hair.
 - The first thing that came to my mind
 was really big hair with a lot of volume.
 - I like bedroom-ish.
 - Every competition needs a bitch and that bitch is me.
 - I'm not putting hair on my head.
 I don't do that.
 - Bitch, I'm here.
 I took up work.
 - Oh, I want to be here.
 - You are beautiful.
 - Thank you.
 - But the judges proved me wrong.
 I feel stupid.
 - I felt good.
 - You did.
 - Let me just say you just did, you know?
 I understand your point, but there's nothing I can do.
 I, you know, I did what I could do
 and what I know to do and--
 - When it came to all of us getting out of drag,
 Nina surprised me because she's covered in tattoos.
 - All right, son, you all tear it up.
 - Jade is very cute.
 I might be a lesbian with him.
 - I do think that they should look out for me
 because I'm going to try and bring it 10 times more
 than I was already going to try and bring it before.
 - No.
 - Wasn't happening.
 - Clearly, you're going to do hair.
 - Part of a wholesome breakfast.
 - Now I want to sabotage everyone.
 - Yeah, maybe the makeup just gave a stay on your face.
 It's just gonna be me and I don't give a (beep)
 what's going on.
 I'm just serving it up.
 - No, I'm trying.
 - I have friends that have lived in my house
 and rent free has stayed or were down and out
 or they can afford to just all around giving.
 I came from pretty much nothing.
 A lot of people that have had a rough life or hard life
 become a better person because of it, I feel stupid.
 I know that she's a kind soul
 and she would give her last drop of money
 to help someone in need.
 (indistinct)
 - Only for me, but he didn't even win.
 - You guys are making it seem like I was horrible
 with the choreography and I know I brought it.
 - You know, appropriately, of course.
 Does it make you decide if you're like everywhere you go,
 there's a boy you want to touch?
 - I thought that she was still
 was going to give me more a challenge
 than just standing there and not lip singing
 the words at all.
 This was my third time in the bottom.
 And so from there, I was like,
 well, I just had to bring it and give it my all
 and not slack and just not them dead.
 I can't do hair.
 I can do the makeup, eat choreography down
 'cause you're dancing.
 You're going to do costumes, since she's so.
 And sewing's not my strong point, clearly from the challenge.
 Girl, I don't think we want to make it go.
 - That's the only thing that's more of a brain.
 - Why did you bring this shadow up?
 - I figured that since she has a little more
 of a bushy eyebrow to go more natural
 instead of trying to go video home,
 it might look like normally is.
 And I do what I see fit and that's just where I am.
 - My vagina got wet, we just grabbed it.
 Hold on, girl, let me pick.
 - Make sure you get the brown one.
 - See this pressure.
 - I do and I think that's why I'm here.
 - I think that the weakest link in my group, it was me.
 If it was not because of I had immunity,
 definitely I should go home.
 - It's, let's start with the finish with costume girl.
 - I don't think anyone's going to have
 an interview, let's get his mind.
 - I think that I have a good chance
 of winning the challenge.
 I just think I rocked that interview.
 - And, I know I have rhythm and I can dance
 and I was socking it in parts of the song.
 And then other parts I felt a lot of choreography.
 - Are we?
 - But you know, I think I might just take my authority
 on this one.
 - Dancing?
 - Drag me.
 - 3D.
 - I just don't know that.
 - Today in entertainment news, pop star Britney Spears
 was caught and then.
 - I felt like I showed people apart of me today,
 haven't been able to see.
 And then hopefully they'll be a little more intimidated
 or know that I'm forced to be reckoned with.
 - After Rebecca took our makeup off,
 I thought she might have had her lips down.
 - Oh, that's good.
 - Did you get your lips plucked?
 - No, they're mine.
 - We all think.
 - Hers is a little flabby.
 It jiggles, mine is solid muscles,
 so it doesn't like move at all.
 So I mean, it just depends on what you're into.
 - Akasha.
 - I know it was good, I'll put it around your waist
 like it's about.
 - We don't.
 - Someone called me the phoenix.
 There's a phoenix that dies and rises from the ashes.
 - I hear it.
 - It's kind of like colors.
 - Hours show.
 - My guests tonight are very special to me.
 We're thrilled to have them here.
 - I was always searching for a way to feel attractive
 and I just--
 - Oh, yeah.
 - Well, I can't do my makeup if my hair is not ready.
 - Well, we don't need this pressure, right?
 - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
 - It was a sigh of relief for me
 since I was in the bottom two.
 I have to step up my game.
 - Do you think you deserve to stay?
 - Since I am the leader of the group,
 I get the final say.
 I'm like, Tammy.
 - I'm thinking, Tammy, we can give you a brown lid.
 Like, almost, um,
 yeah, we all reminisce about the upper challenge.
 Everyone's saying that they did really good
 so it's like, well, did I really do as well as I saw it?
 I did.
 - Get in marks, get in marks, get in marks.
 - Well, I'm not touching them, I guess not.
 My name is Eric.
 I'm 24 years old.
 My name is Akasha, when I'm in drag.
 My drag persona would be crazy, rambunctious.
 - I'm sitting here all prepped and ready.
 - If I was a girl, I would be a stripper.
 - Or slept and pregnant with a whole bunch of children.
 - We both decided to do the whole naked feel.
 - When I saw Chanel, I was like,
 oh, another skank with her butt hanging out.
 I thought I was gonna be the only one that had
 my butt hanging out.
 - And then the thing with me,
 you guys are doing it for my name.
 - Perfect.
 - Every single member of the team
 was assigned to do something different.
 - I'm relying for every single one of you
 to tell me your creative process.
 - Chanel was assigned to do the makeup.
 - Our visual should be face, feminine.
 They were a little fish, but with that little sexy.
 - On Jaina, she is doing the choreography.
 - I'm gonna do it really easy,
 but there's gonna be technicalities to it.
 - Rebecca is working on the outfits out of them.
 - Hey, girl, you look so good in that little dress.
 - I love it.
 - I think that you need to be an entertainer
 in all aspects.
 A lot of people miss to assume that if you do drag,
 you wanna be a woman.
 I don't.
 I'm happy who I am.
 - Hey, how are ya?
 - How are ya?
 - So baby, I know how much you love me
 and you wanna be like me.
 So your makeup is gonna look just like mine.
 - Okay.
 - I have a little bit of a challenge
 because I'm not very good at choreography.
 - I'm reading was never my strongest suit.
 I failed English just like three times.
 - The two have met last year at a conference on you.
 - Thank you very much.
 - If you want to marry me, I might try and steal.
 - What the hell am I supposed to do with this craft?
 - After all the judges were saying to me before,
 it's like you're like the poison to everyone.
 And then for them to turn around to do a 180, it was crazy.
 - I felt fierce, honey.
 I said, I look good.
 - I did smile at the end of the runway
 to show that my pearly whites 'cause I have a gorgeous smile.
 - I really thought that all hope was lost
 and I was coming home.
 When I was 17, I got kicked out mainly because I was gay.
 And so I pretty much depend on myself.
 - I sawed in this challenge.
 - If I would have immunity, I would definitely
 would have been on the bottom too.
 - Come on.
 - I am nuts.
 - I need help though.
 - Be a champ, hold it.
 - Girl, put it on the way hand.
 That's what they're for.
 - Jade is very cute.
 I might be a lesbian with him.
 Hammy, her eyebrows aren't as a boy or just out of whack.
 You just want to take a weed whacker and just attack them.
 Oh, bro.
 - What's going on here?
 - But you know, it happens.
 - We're doing the capes out.
 - First we have to start our road.
 - I like to entertain people.
 I like the attention.
 They just build a cross snip like that so you rip it off
 and phrase the accent and you can get touched.
 - Hi, my name's Akasha or Eric.
 I'm 24 years old.
 I think the drag is entertaining.
 - Sabatage, Sabatage.
 - Come on, come on.
 - The gas is just all right.
 - No, I'm not.
 It's kind of not much of a dress because there's not much
 fabric since I don't like to wear it much close.
 - Oh, I got that.
 - Oh, I got that.
 - Hey, baby.
 - Hold it, hold it.
 - Me and Anjano won the mini challenge,
 which made us both captains to form
 two girl groups.
 - You guys are making it seem like I was horrible
 with the choreography and I know I brought it.
 - It also has the shots where it just shoots really rapidly.
 - So you do any tons of around your board?
 - I do lots of contour.
 - I've never seen you use it around like.
 - I have it on there.
 You just don't notice it.
 I make it look natural.
 - It look a real woman.
 - Well, are you trying to say mine
 doesn't look like a real woman?
 - Yours looks a little forced.
 - Why are you doing that?
 - I'm not putting hair on my head without a face on.
 - You're coming in today without Victoria.
 - Every competition needs a bitch and that bitch is me
 and I'm happy with that.
 I tell it how it is and I'm fierce.
 - Well, say goodnight to everyone.
 Goodnight everyone.
 - That's a (beep) one.
 - I was assigned to do the hair.
 - My only concern is that everyone of us is different.
 - I'll mention that one.
 - That one's small.
 - Let's see what's last.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - I would throw it in that sense or stuff.
 And I literally thought, what the hell
 am I supposed to do with this crap?
 - I orchestrated what I wanted and then I went back next.
 And again, if this was okay, if this was okay,
 then this was okay.
 - I really did not want Tammy.
 Me and Tammy have personalities that clash.
