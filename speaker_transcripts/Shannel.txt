 - Wow, she has never been done alive.
 - I swear to God, I think I brought like 22 costumes.
 - 22, 16 pairs of yours.
 - Yeah, I have had dresses.
 I mean, I have got some amazing, amazing shoes.
 - These girls take their drag seriously.
 I'm here because I'm a professional entertainer
 and I want to be able to give and to create showmanship
 for the world to be able to see that the art of drag
 is not about putting on a dress and prancing around
 is that there's so much more involved in what we are
 and who we are as men, as well as when we are women.
 (laughing)
 You're going down.
 - That's weird.
 - You're just weird.
 - If she's here, I will die.
 - And come up by letting Rebecca stay.
 - Morning, how are you?
 - Out in left field somewhere to me.
 - There is only one hairdryer to use.
 The Oz and All Professional.
 - Bottom here?
 - Yes, very low by the back.
 - Although being safe is okay, it's not good enough for me.
 There is no second or third.
 It's first, or it's don't even bother.
 - I'm sorry.
 - Thank you very much.
 - I'm sorry.
 - You know it?
 - There you go.
 - There you go.
 - I believe you can do it.
 - Finish me.
 - Finish me.
 - Finish me.
 - I don't know who doesn't know who Oprah is.
 I mean, it's like saying you don't know who Cher is.
 I mean, really.
 - I'm sorry, I feel stupid.
 - Oh, I swear to say.
 - You know what I mean?
 I'm using my hands as well.
 - Oh.
 - I don't know.
 - I do so.
 - Look at this.
 - Hey.
 - But, but, but.
 - I come, I f*ck it up all together.
 - Completely.
 - I thought I sucked.
 - I'm gonna fall.
 - You are.
 - Hold me.
 - Squeeze it in.
 Here you go.
 - Don't f*ck it up.
 - And they said I did fine.
 - For me, the best thing to do is just to bow out.
 Me being here is serving me no purpose
 because nothing I'm doing they like.
 - Thank you.
 - I don't sell.
 - I don't know game, baby.
 - I don't know game.
 - I thought, wow, there's one team here
 that doesn't seem like they're really cohesive
 in their mindset.
 - I do.
 - Yes, I do.
 - Yeah, I do, I do.
 - I don't know what my feelings are
 because I feel that RuPaul made a really bad decision.
 - You have to look like Oprah.
 - And I don't feel that I am being understood here.
 - I am.
 - How long exactly do we have from right now?
 - Right.
 - Look at your Oprah challenge.
 - Based on the fact that she has immunity,
 I would say Nina.
 - We were given an hour and a half this morning
 to completely get ourselves into drag.
 You know, over here we've got my shoe wall
 of a huge plethora of different shoes.
 And along this wall is a varied of different types
 of gowns and curtains and costumes
 and different types of illusions.
 And on this wall we have got different ways
 from Cher to Barbara Streisand, Madonna
 and even a tribute to Star Wars Queen Amidala.
 A little bit of a weight to the camera,
 a little bit of a shoulder, a little hand to the hip
 and a slight walk off, a little bit of a saunter
 if you will, over here into my own personal drag domain.
 And so until we meet again, in Los Angeles,
 I'll see you soon, good night.
 - BB, step into it, put your hands on those hips
 and show them strength and power.
 - Okay.
 - But still having...
 - Points.
 - Elegant to beauty.
 - Okay.
 - You have survived this (beep) twice.
 - Good timing.
 - No problem, thank you, Sashay.
 - I did.
 - That's nice.
 - Good morning.
 - Wing up.
 - I was very young.
 I was a very impressionable age and time in my life
 having just come out a couple years prior
 and being in high school and being that overweight kid
 who sat in the back of the classroom
 and really didn't have any friends.
 - Wow, I was 42 inches around.
 - You have been?
 - And it is literally because of her show
 and her inspiration that I lost all of that leg.
 - Okay.
 - What does that even mean?
 What do you think?
 - I'm gonna make one of these...
 - What is this?
 - I'm gonna give you a packet with eight of size 28B stones
 and this is exactly where they should be put.
 - Okay.
 - I can't hear to win anything that is thrown at me.
 I can do and I will do with excellence.
 Do I think I have a great opportunity to win this?
 Absolutely, I think I do.
 You are her truest.
 I have to completely be redone on you.
 Good luck.
 - Thank you.
 - All right, I wanted to create a very new delusion.
 Yeah, so this actually will go all the way through the leg.
 Ooh.
 - Six questions at once.
 - Tomorrow.
 - Do I have a shot at winning this competition?
 Absolutely.
 - I came across as being very sincere and true,
 which of course is what Oprah is.
 - Because I don't want to be here anymore.
 - All of a sudden.
 - Hello, this hair.
 Shout out what do you think.
 - Honestly, I'm not that crazy about it.
 That's my personal opinion.
 Not because I don't like the hair.
 This hair to me is very Texas pageant
 and our dresses, our outfits are very like teeny-bopper.
 - Feel it and then just, ooh, just walk it.
 - The challenge.
 - I am a Vegas showgirl, I love costumes.
 - Welcome back to the Nina Show.
 - I was like, uh, okay, I'm ready to pass out.
 Is there pens in there?
 - On China.
 - So I just, I don't want to be taking your job away
 and I feel like I'm causing the problem and I'm not.
 - Honestly, next to impossible for me to answer that question,
 the way I know you want the question answered.
 - Start your engines.
 - That was an interesting experience.
 - I'm a beautiful person internally and on the outside.
 And it's so, so frustrating to me
 that that image does not seem to be conveyed.
 Week after week, when we come into an elimination round,
 I am so negatively critiqued.
 - So, more realness.
 - You know, this is significantly more understated
 than what I would normally do.
 I would normally have peplums and, you know,
 a real big asymmetrical collar and things like that.
 I am a showgirl from Las Vegas.
 I like big grand over-the-top costumes.
 I'm not one to wear simple things and to do simple things.
 There is a level of expectation that you have to uphold.
 This is not an easy challenge.
 I'm setting myself up for failure.
 - But, why can't I be like that?
 - Clue, Rebecca doesn't want us to believe
 that she was trying to handicap us.
 - No, I want a pen.
 And I had one that was with my notebook that's now gone.
 - No one likes Rebecca.
 But she is able to stir the pot and to create some drama.
 That's why she's here.
 But I'm not bitter about that.
 That's okay.
 - Listening to the criticism
 was both frustrating and embarrassing for me
 because it really hit home for me.
 (laughing)
 - Just keep in mind that when you're doing that,
 don't do this.
 Don't want like a man.
 - Okay, stand there and do this a little bit.
 Just relax it.
 - Y'all should know.
 - Sorry, maybe naked.
 - Screen test.
 - I am your Mac Viva Glam Diva.
 Every time you pass by a Mac store
 and you pick up a tube of lipstick,
 every cent of every dollar that it will be spent
 on that tube of lipstick will be put towards
 helping to find a cure.
 Join us and helping to fight for the cure.
 I'm just going to go out there and I'm honestly,
 I'm just going to be me.
 I'm not even really gonna be Chanel.
 I'll be Chanel visually, but I'm gonna,
 I think just be Brian.
 And I'm gonna talk from the heart.
 - When I was first introduced,
 I would not at all be surprised if I was sent home.
 - We have no idea what we look like.
 - Why should you win?
 - You're fine.
 - Sitting there in the chair, actually,
 I have, you know, no control whatsoever over what's happening.
 So that was weird.
 - I don't want my tucking and all that showing me.
 What just happened?
 - So, Phoebe Winfrey.
 - Phoebe!
 - Phoebe!
 (laughing)
 - It is true.
 - Yeah, I mean, I drew my designs out that I want.
 - Ooh, missed out the body.
 Oh my goodness.
 I contemplated on a couple of different ideas for Oprah.
 - And where would your Oprah wear this outfit?
 - This is not something that she would per se
 wear on this show because it's a little too couture.
 However, if she was speaking at Tuskegee Institute,
 you know what I mean?
 If she was speaking somewhere outside of Harpo Studios
 and she needed to be a little more fashion forward,
 slightly runway, she could wear something like this
 versus doing a gown.
 And I'm incorporating a really nice stretch legging.
 - How do you feel about this Chanel?
 - Horrible, yeah.
 I have an idea and my mind is execute.
 - A mega merger.
 - He, like, threw me.
 - He feels so weird without G, doesn't he?
 - Yeah.
 - Chanel is just running around, freaking out.
 Ears, your heart.
 - Listen.
 - Today is the beginning of another challenge
 and of course no one knows exactly what that challenge
 is gonna be, so there's a lot of anticipation.
 - I definitely never thought I was gonna be
 in the bottom, too.
 - The fact of having a lip sync for my life was,
 - Are you ready yet?
 - Oh.
 - Throw a little attitude in it.
 Throw some shoulder, throw some eyes.
 Chanel is about representing eyes and glamor
 and diva and strength and body.
 I said, so if you're going out there as my sister
 and I'm putting you together,
 I want you to embody that.
 - That's what's really gonna be able
 to lock in that lip sync for you.
 - Do all of that.
 I'm not as a mistress.
 - Me either.
 - I should have won.
 I should have won this challenge.
 I deserved to win this challenge.
 - Okay.
 - We're still here.
 - We're still here.
 - Well, no, well, yes but no, yes but no, I guess.
 I think it is not.
 - Thank you.
 - It wears.
 - Well, hi there.
 I'm a delicious mismandering.
 (gasping)
 - Rebecca.
 - She's a little delusional.
 - I think that in her mind,
 she thinks that she's won this entire competition
 and if she has,
 I think that that would be a very sad representation
 of what Drag is supposed to be in America.
 I've had about two hours of sleep
 and due to the fact that it is elimination day,
 it makes me feel like I don't even know
 why I should bother going on.
 - Because I've heard she's a real bitch
 and she's anal-retentive about everything.
 - Hey, how are you?
 - I'm good.
 - Today is elimination day
 and I knew I fumbled
 through my VivaGlam challenge yesterday.
 - So I figured, you know, this is the left,
 like the world is.
 - I think it is.
 - When RuPaul announced that Rebecca had won the challenge,
 I was bitch-realness.
 - I don't want to be taking your job away.
 - Let me just say you just did.
 - I am amazed at myself.
 - I had my hand really in a lot of the entire package
 of what we did.
 We are doing a production number
 of one of Destiny's Childs Songs.
 - What kind of weight colors?
 - There we go.
 - Here we go.
 - Here we go.
 - So I was a little scared.
 - What I've done is I created a full face chart.
 I actually have done one for every single person.
 They're exactly the same.
 - They're your face, aren't they?
 - We have to interview two people and what else?
 - We have to read from the teleprompter
 like we're doing the news.
 - Okay.
 - We're going to have a real vagina mama.
 - Okay, so technically right now,
 we're all supposed to be doing our makeup, right?
 - We're the beginning to do all of that.
 - Right.
 - I'm not a seamstress.
 - Me, the bottom line.
 - But you're backwards.
 - Oh yeah, that's right.
 - Sorry.
 - Hold up.
 - Good morning.
 - Rebecca took a very mommy dearest
 Joan Crawford approach temple.
 - How are you, Rebecca?
 - You're a weird girl on the couch.
 - Yes, you may lay down on the couch.
 Here's a towel if you'd like.
 - Although sad because Miss Victoria Parker
 was sent home, so there is now eight of us
 instead of nine of us.
 - They're looking for the all of those things
 that Oprah possesses as a person
 in your interpretation of her.
 - 8-ness.
 - Rebecca, I got a whole roller duct tape
 with your name on a kitten.
 - All right.
 - And the gorilla kind, you know,
 the kind that will hang an airplane from the ceiling.
 - See, I'm scared to wear this,
 which I could wear from my executive,
 but then I'm going to be told it's too much again.
 - He's hard.
 - It's absolutely horrible.
 - With the bathing suit.
 - It's like, I don't even know.
 - There is no cure and it is with your help and me,
 all of us together and joining together
 that will help to create.
 - No, I know, I'm trying it.
 - No, I don't know, I know, I know.
 - In my stomach, there's a lot of butterflies
 hoping that everybody else is able to do the makeup
 that I have put on the face charts for them.
 - Do your lips put on lashes?
 - Okay.
 - And then when I'm finished,
 which we'll be very shortly,
 I will go back in.
 - Okay.
 - Okay.
 - My biggest fear about tomorrow's performance
 would be me being the one to screw up
 any choreography on stage.
 - That's kind of, I guess you could say how I--
 - That's me on stage.
 - Okay.
 - Honestly, I'm up.
 - 'Cause I don't believe in myself right now
 to be honest with you.
 - No, I'm saying that.
 - You're supposed to be on stage in an hour and a half.
 - Rebecca.
 - Yes I am.
 - Why can't you know, sometimes the reality shows they do that.
 You know where they decide no one will be?
 - You sure?
 - Yeah.
 - Beautiful.
 - Bottom line is, Rebecca has no.
 - Since day one, I have been judged really hard
 and I'm very frustrated that you can't see the personality
 because I am--
 - Okay.
 - Very defined you by the sound.
 - That's not gonna do with what this is about.
 - And literally give complete four minutes
 and you've got to ask about three different topics.
 - I am by far the biggest fan of Oprah in the entire room.
 - First of all, good afternoon, RuPaul
 and our distinguished panel of judges.
 As an entertainer and as a gentleman,
 I am happy with who I am.
 I look in the mirror and I love myself.
 - Do it.
 - 'Cause we're supposed to be on stage in an hour and a half.
 - All right.
 - I would highly doubt that anybody in this entire competition
 can do makeup the way I can do makeup.
 - I was very pleased with my selection
 for the executive look.
 - So I was pretty confident today.
 - Oh God, Rebecca deserved to go home.
 - Is it harder than what you expected
 or is it kind of, you know, right where you would plan it to be?
 Or had you really planned or did you even know?
 - To Blissie, to Tehran.
 - I'm depend.
 - Completely.
 Anjina, being our team leader, was absolutely exceptional.
 - I have a feeling that the judges in their mind
 already think, oh, she thinks she's gonna win this.
 So we're going to give her no reaction
 as to not boost her confidence level
 any more than it probably already is.
 - No, no, no, no, no, big time.
 Was motherhood really all that you had expected it to be?
 Is it harder than what you expected?
 Or is it kind of, you know, right where you would plan it to be?
 Or had you really planned or did you even know?
 - They never said, no, you don't understand.
 Oprah and Cher are gone.
 Oprah Winfrey to me might as well be president.
 I think Oprah is the most amazing person on earth
 because of all of the things she's been able to do
 with her career, literally for the entire world.
 - I fully agree because I took all of their advice
 that they gave me.
 - 100% recycled fashion.
 - No.
 - We're not only performing a song with choreography
 that's brand new, but we're also doing it
 for one of Destiny's Children, Michelle Williams.
 So it puts a little bit more pressure on the situation.
 - Oprah, for me, is God.
 - I am partnered with Sweet Pea,
 who is probably the most masculine,
 definitely of the entire group.
 - Okay.
 - Me, me, me, me.
 - Rebecca has been able to mislead everybody
 into believing how innocent she is.
 But she hasn't misled me.
 I know the fake person that lies
 underneath all that cosmetics.
 - Thank you.
 And these are getting in the way.
 - What made you stick with that, you know,
 kind of a Lexus Carrington look?
 - Felt that I embodied an element of Oprah
 and is an element of me.
 - But something--
 - Beautiful.
 - Thank you.
 - I'm like, baby, don't get through that.
 - And just, you know, the execution of it is hard.
 So this is a big challenge for me.
 - It's not a competition of, oh, who looks the most like Oprah?
 - Strip or wear.
 - Okay, so I feel like we're taking two extremes.
 Our look was completely unrealistic.
 The hair, the costuming.
 So I wasn't sure if that I was going to be able
 to achieve with all of the girls exactly what I wanted
 in order to create a very cohesive look.
 I've probably got about $25,000 in costuming
 in rhinestones with me.
 I've got head pieces and head dresses
 and 16 pairs of shoes, 22 outfits,
 things with Versace buckles on them.
 And our challenge is create a fabulous outfit
 from some of the ugliest, tackiest,
 most horrible thrift store clothing
 that your grandmother wouldn't even wear.
 Now, most importantly, for the contest.
 - In answer to your question, I nominate myself.
 - But she was making--
 - I've embellished a bra and belt.
 - When I just don't seem to be successful.
 - I don't know what more of myself I can give.
 - Thank you, judges.
 - Thank you very much.
 My name is Brian, I'm 29 years old,
 and I've had a show at a nightclub in Las Vegas
 for about six years now.
 This is sickening.
 My persona has always tried to be a little more
 on the realistic side, but wearing costuming
 that is super couture.
 People call me the barber's trice and of drag.
 This is gonna be fun, fun, fun, fun.
 I don't know what more of myself I can give, devastated.
 I feel like I should have won that challenge, real.
 You have no idea.
 In my mind, I've already won.
 Well, Jade embodies an all around 110% beautiful person
 inside and out.
 - Nice to meet you.
 - I'm tired.
 - I'm tired, but I'm sad.
 - Like filming me a long bridge.
 - Oh, you don't bend your knees.
 - That's what you think.
 - It's crazy, isn't it?
 Rebecca is here for the game.
 I see many different sides of Rebecca.
 Some are very nice, very beautiful, very put together,
 and some are a little underhanded.
 After sitting down and kind of gathering my thoughts
 from it, I realized, well, I'm so glad
 you asked me this question.
 I nominate myself.
 It was fun, but the cuffs didn't really lend themselves
 to me juggling on the runway,
 and I didn't want to be in a corset,
 and I like showing my body.
 Wow, crazy, crazy, crazy.
 - Communities are slow.
 - Let's give a big round of applause
 for the absolutely incomparable,
 my very special guest, Tori Faling and Dean McDonut.
 - Nuclear, proper filler.
 - I'm giving a feeling of elegance, confidence,
 beauty, and business all in one, hands down.
 - It's on the clock for Chanel.
 - Hi there, good evening and welcome.
 I am your Mac Viva Glenn Diva.
 We all know that Mac has revolutionized
 the cosmetic industry.
 - In 1998, my best friend, Patricia,
 and I decided that we were gonna go to the Mac store.
 - For two years, Patricia wore that limb stick.
 - That limb stick called me and wanted me
 to help her support out.
 - It wasn't that too much.
 - That too lipstick that helped me get through
 every time I passed by a Mac store,
 and you pick up a tube of lipstick.
 - Everybody to be able to come together into--
 - Okay, stop the clock, please.
 - If you can do it so that we could fit it into 30 seconds.
 You know, I just, I interpreted the whole thing differently,
 I guess, so now I'm just, I'm sorry.
 - I was stopped because I said that I, you know,
 essentially wasn't doing it correctly.
 - Well, I don't, I guess I shouldn't really tell a story
 or anything here then.
 I got very confused because I had prepared everything
 differently in my mind.
 - Hey!
 - Oh my gosh.
 - Is she amazing?
 So was, was motherhood really all that you had expected it
 to be?
 Is it harder than what you had expected?
 Or is it kind of, you know, right where you would
 plan it to be?
 Or had you really planned?
 Or did you even know?
 - Literally, we have just taken a bath in water,
 in full drag.
 Everything is just nasty and disgusting.
 Unfortunately, we could take it all off and I thought,
 "Oh, thank God."
 - Look at that titty.
 - What they're looking at is, did you know the words?
 Make sure that as you're learning those words
 that you feel it here.
 - She looks a little draggy.
 - I love who I am.
 So I thank you all, and most importantly,
 I am honored to be here.
 My name is Chanel, thank you all so much,
 and have a wonderful night.
 - Thank you, Chanel.
 - Thank you.
 - At all.
 - Wait.
 - Why?
 - Because I couldn't get my mind off of this.
 - You are.
 - That God.
 - I was completely blown away, because so much of what comes
 back to me from the judges is so negative.
 - Six questions.
 - I'm coming up.
 - I'm gonna have to put my balls behind my freaking body today.
 - I got a whole roller duct tape with your name on it.
 - Get on with me.
 - You're in the bottom too.
 - Oh my God.
 - And then you know what?
 - I'm gonna go on with that.
 - Okay.
 - Nine weeks.
 - You might wanna start trying to cover the beard.
 - Maybe one dark do you think so that we're all--
 - Exactly.
 - What are the suits?
 What do you think?
 - The other things you want to keep them on
 or are you thinking to cut them in to do something
 like short and fun and like that.
 - And they didn't like it either.
 - I'm very visual with things, and I'm very good with,
 you know, give me something and I'll drape things
 and I'll piece it together.
 But when it comes to the construction of something,
 it's, I got on this show.
 I was able to show the world that I have a fabulous body
 that I'm beautiful, which is so nice to be told finally today.
 - This morning in the work room we were given
 an hour and a half time frame to complete everything.
 There was definitely a high level of stress.
 Obviously no one wants to go home.
 - Bring the beat back.
 - It's so gross.
 - Rebecca is here for the game.
 I see many different sides of Rebecca
 and some are a little underhanded.
 I thought to myself, just keep going, keep going,
 keep going, don't stop, don't pause, just make it happen.
 - Pleasure is sitting here now.
 Where are you from?
 - The two who met last year at a conference
 on nuclear proliferation in the Malaysian city
 of Kuala Lumpur were caught canoodling from...
 - Okay, why did you bring this shadow up round like that?
 We're bringing our colors.
 - Absolutely.
 - I didn't get here after almost 15 years
 from not listening and building those blocks
 to take what it takes to be headlining in shows
 in Las Vegas.
 But this competition is about...
 - And to me voguing is about posing
 and just being bitchy and in your face.
 I did it well.
 Like, what?
 - No, no, no, you can't say that.
 I'm the spiritual person.
 - No, no, no, no.
 - Oprah is responsible literally for me originally
 when I lost over 60 pounds of my weight originally.
 - You were that big?
 - I was too 17.
 I feel stupid.
 - Straight down on your knees.
 - I've never seen myself with two sets of eyebrows,
 so that's kind of different.
 - Shocking.
 As she's walking out the runway,
 all I can think of is, wow,
 you are amazing and in literally 24 hours,
 I took you and I made you the complete and total package.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry,
 I thought you had moved your hand.
 I thought they meant to stop.
 Just plug it in and blow.
 I miss Tammy.
 - I miss her too.
 - I think that she added an incredible level
 of quirkiness and funnness to this entire group.
 - Yes, she did.
 - Anna, you're gonna be kidding.
 - Why not?
 - I have a lot of integrity and I am a fighter,
 not physically, but mentally.
 So I thought, well, I'm gonna give it my best shot
 and I hope I don't throw up.
 I'm doing a diagram of what I want to work
 and I'm writing down the key products in our Mac Makeup box.
 I was chosen as a makeup artist,
 which was probably the best decision
 when it comes to the ability to be able
 to character illusionize makeup on someone's face.
 I serve that up well.
 - You have to, I think visually my appearance
 on the runway was unbelievably over the top
 and 110% of the total expression
 of who I am as an entertainer.
 - I was surprised at the Bogoff
 because I think that it should have been Nina and myself.
 - This is no joke.
 I mean, I was sweating like some sort of pig and he.
 I'm nauseous.
 - So as far as I'm concerned,
 there is no challenge from me here.
 - I mean, originally watching 90210 was amazing.
 You were always one of my true fans.
 I even have the doll of you.
 - Yeah.
 - As I.
 That looks very complex.
 You need to really slow it down when you're showing it.
 - I am a very versatile entertainer.
 I'm a character illusionist.
 I am a comedian and I'm a showgirl.
 However, I'm not a choreographed dancer.
 - How do you feel like if you were not mid drifted
 but you had material coming down your body
 but with maybe some cut out on the side?
 - What?
 I honestly, I feel, yeah, I'm honestly, I'm dizzy.
 My heart is racing really bad and I'm just shaking.
 I was so winded and so literally feeling
 like I'm gonna vomit.
