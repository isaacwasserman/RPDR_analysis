 - Your time has come for you to lip sync for your life.
 Hey Rebecca, it looks like you're the only one
 sewing your own outfit.
 - Mark Dafloa!
 - Yeah we can.
 - Yes it is?
 - Yes it is.
 - It really is.
 - You're so welcome.
 - Now judges, this is gonna be fun.
 - No matter when our time together ends.
 So we're down to two queens, Akasha.
 - Thank you.
 - Well hello students, Professor Roo here.
 It's time for a little pop quiz.
 - Now I'm gonna ask you some questions.
 - Are y'all ready to play?
 - We might have.
 - Question number one.
 - Which US city is known as the Windy City?
 - I've been on the second.
 - Somebody told me that you were late to the set
 and the director was waiting for you.
 - Oh.
 - Zelda Marcos would die for that.
 Oh she is dead.
 - All right, now it's all.
 - Are you ready to play?
 - No.
 - Keep burning today.
 - Ooh.
 - Hey girl.
 - Hey honey.
 Show me the house.
 - I'm like this.
 - You and Temple, each win gift baskets
 from Carlisto worth $1,000.
 Congratulations, you're still in the race.
 - You have a lot of charisma, which we all love.
 We're all rooting for you,
 but do you have the, let the music play?
 You are safe.
 - At tomorrow's presentation on the main stage,
 no one has immunity.
 So make this challenge count.
 - It's not always gonna be pretty.
 - I just don't get it.
 - We don't need this pressure.
 - It's so fun to me.
 - Yeah, the time has come.
 - Anjana.
 - But the winner of RuPaul's Drag Race
 gets an extra special bonus.
 He'll take turns voting.
 And when the music starts, you'll hit it.
 At the end, I'll pick a winner.
 - I'll see you dolls next week.
 - Your mission is to make over your girl fighter
 into your cell.
 - Okay, she's giving Barbara McNair.
 Ladies, the judges have calculated your scores.
 - Now, because tomorrow's house ball is all about realness,
 you need to incorporate your real fruit.
 - What's up, girl?
 - So for your next challenge,
 I want you to channel your inner Oprah.
 You have to create your own Oprah inspired look.
 Now you may choose one of the outfits
 provided by the pit crew, start from scratch,
 or pull something from your own closet.
 - You're the loser of this challenge.
 - Wow, that was fantastic.
 - I'll be watching the winner where we see you.
 Chanel.
 - Rebecca Glasgow.
 Oh, is that a call?
 Hello?
 Donald Trump.
 You old geezer.
 (laughing)
 Oh, this is from yellow.
 (cheering)
 - All right, here we go.
 - That's right, if you can't stand the heat,
 get out of the boardroom.
 Now, everything is looking great on the outside.
 Anjana and Jared, come on down.
 So what we expected of you.
 - This is Kiss Army Meets Rizzo in Greece.
 Centino.
 - I knew that was coming, I swear I did.
 - She's no longer on the farm, Rebecca has escaped.
 - Your girl fighters are going to
 to be the next drag superstar.
 - Nothing.
 - Gorgeous.
 You can leave the stage, you're still in the race.
 - Our third finalist is as different from Nina,
 as Nina is from BB.
 - Riga Doon.
 - Leave a glam.
 - I can't wait to see the--
 - Pasha.
 - Oh no.
 - I'm giving her a tough look.
 - BB.
 - Thank you both very much.
 You may join the other girls.
 - Hey, hey, hey, hey.
 - Hello, hello, hello.
 - This is your last chance to impress me
 and save yourself from elimination.
 - Somebody cut the cheese.
 - Or it is swimsuit.
 Coming up, for the first time on the main stage,
 the girls will be wearing their very own drag creations.
 Dramatic, never-before-seen outtakes.
 - Tomorrow, show time.
 - When you'll be performing for Michelle,
 Williams, and the judges.
 Now make me proud.
 And remember.
 - I know.
 - Who was this bitch turned it out?
 - Nina Flowers.
 - Oh, right.
 - I'm scared of you.
 - Oh my goodness, the drama continues.
 This performance actually proved
 that you could be vulnerable.
 - You're gonna need to dig a little deeper.
 - Coming up.
 - I have to excuse myself.
 This decision is too difficult.
 And things got a little extra caliente
 with our special guest star, Charles, stop by.
 - Wow, dolls.
 - Who wants a cocktail?
 - I do.
 - Well, let's see 'em.
 - Come on, let's see it.
 - Take your other shoe off.
 - Your nails are painted your halfway there, honey.
 - 'Cause now, you're gonna get the chance
 to do one another.
 - Well, I mean, was that the only one who noticed that?
 - No, no, no.
 - No, no, no.
 - And it's not crisp.
 - As a further reward.
 - How are you pulling inspiration for this?
 - Hello, my drag warriors.
 You are asked to prepare our girl fighters
 for a lip sync performance of Beyonce's "Freakum Dress."
 (upbeat music)
 - Congratulations.
 - Well, girls, while all y'all go wait
 in the interior illusions lounge,
 the judges and I will deliberate.
 And Rebecca, but three different drag looks.
 The first category is swimwear,
 because looking sexy and unspookable
 in a swimsuit is the ultimate test of a drag illusionist.
 The second category is realness, executive realness.
 You will be asked to pass as a real business woman,
 not a drag queen, now dolls,
 to further inspire your creations.
 Each of you will represent
 a different, absolute fruit flavor.
 This looks like it's all from the fifth store.
 What here's from the 99 cents store?
 It's like a lady matrix.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - You outshined on China.
 When people look at you,
 they can connect with what's going on behind the eyes.
 They won't care what's going on between the thighs.
 - Yes!
 - Sweet Pea, what was your experience working with Chanel?
 - Of course, that means Jay,
 you'll be teamed with Nina Flowers.
 Now, this is the bad news, actually.
 You'll only have 30 minutes to do your partner's face.
 - Here you are like, come get me, okay?
 But here, you're a little demure.
 I'm not being demure.
 You just seem a little shy,
 mainly when you walk the runway.
 Coming up, today's challenge is drag on a dime.
 You mother (beep) broke the dawn,
 and then there were three.
 They pushed it one step further.
 And that's why you're so special,
 because you get to pass this message on.
 - Yeah. - Ancient Chinese secrets.
 - Amen. - Amen.
 - Good luck.
 - Well, would you take the two?
 - Wow.
 - Hi, Evan. - Okay, girls.
 Nina Flowers, you've won this challenge.
 - Whoo!
 - Get it, girl.
 - Welcome back to this extra special edition
 of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 After six grueling episodes,
 Bibi, Rebecca, and Nina
 have made it to the final three.
 And what a wild ride it's been.
 - Good evening and welcome
 to the main stage of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 As always, I'd like to say hello
 to my fabulous judges,
 the fashion journalist and best-selling author,
 Merle Ginsburg,
 and hello to my pal,
 the shamelessly outspoken designer, Santino.
 Now, this week, we have two extra special guest judges.
 First up is the founder of the Pussycat Dolls,
 Miss Robin Anton.
 And it's gonna keep you here again.
 - Dolls can I get your attention?
 I have a little announcement to make.
 Now, I know you guys are under a lot of pressure,
 and it's important to do your work here.
 But it's also important to remember to have some fun,
 just spice it up a little bit.
 ♪ A little absolute cocktail party ♪
 - Victoria, while you all go
 and wait in the Interior Illusions Lounge,
 the judges and I will deliberate.
 - Please step forward, Mia and Nina.
 - Sorry, Chanel.
 You are all special.
 - Go for it.
 - I'm extremely nervous.
 - Just relax.
 Don't walk like a man.
 - This decision is too difficult.
 - I have to excuse myself.
 - As always, the judges will be looking
 for your charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
 Now, you have to go here.
 - Yeah.
 - But you're all crazy.
 You're gonna break up the group.
 - I think it's actually quite good.
 I love the color combination.
 - Mm.
 - The alluring, the beautiful, the fabulous Rebecca.
 3D.
 So I'm gonna start with Michelle Williams.
 - Yeah.
 - Bring the girls back.
 - Or should I say, Lanine Harro.
 Sashay, and one of you.
 - I think from the neck down.
 - I think from the neck down.
 - Yeah?
 - One criticism about their presentation.
 - Oh.
 (laughing)
 - True number, they're here to serve their queen
 in any way you need.
 (laughing)
 - With five contestants left, everyone knew
 they were in for the fight of their lives.
 Little did they know, that meant a real girl.
 - Boy did I--
 - Could you?
 - Which means you can stay
 and ask one of you to Sashay.
 - Good answer, but you know, of course,
 you're gonna have to tune in next week
 with everyone else to find out who will win
 RuPaul's Drag Race.
 - I, and finally, here are two songs.
 I'll let you decide which group performs which song.
 You'll have one day to prepare.
 - Gentlemen, good evening and welcome
 to the main stage of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 - Ah!
 - Lina!
 - Thank you all for your honesty.
 - Yes.
 - Kasha.
 - Hello, hello, hello.
 - Thank you, Rebecca.
 You may join the other ladies.
 - And finally, someone who knows a thing or two
 about being a tough woman.
 Please welcome Zina Warrior Princess Miss Lucy Lawless.
 - I've earned this together.
 - You wanna show me that's right.
 - The girls were nothing, if not educational.
 - May the best woman win!
 - From thousands of submissions, you are the chosen nine.
 - Really?
 - God, I'm frightened.
 - Now make me proud, ladies.
 - A lot of snakes on this mother.
 - In the house bowl, you'll be asked to create not one.
 Now make me proud.
 And remember, Michelle, can you handle this?
 - I hope it airs right after this one.
 - Hey, turn it on the runway.
 The question is, do you have the nerve?
 All right, keep it hood, keep it real, Kasha.
 Nina, your first pose is,
 you just found out your $10,000 Louis Vuitton bag
 is a fake, which was my first national cover.
 Now, I know that Chanel was in charge of makeup.
 You guys looked fantastic, I love the makeup.
 What were you in charge of?
 - I was in charge of costuming.
 They're gorgeous costumes.
 Chante, you stay.
 - Somebody just cut the cheese?
 - Looks like you're about to take a bite out of crime.
 - Work, Loca.
 - Loca.
 - You're gorgeous.
 Honey, you are a fabulous queen.
 - You'll be my first kiss.
 - Ooh, extravaganza, pow.
 - For your life.
 - The next day, the two teams faced off
 in a girl group showdown.
 - BB, I think you have a day for Saturday night, by the way.
 - On China.
 - Yes.
 - What would you say to Chanel?
 - You can't love yourself.
 How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
 Can I get amen in here?
 - Amen.
 - All right.
 - Okay.
 - What?
 - Uh, uh.
 BB.
 - Ooh, praise Jesus.
 And don't forget the incredible reveal.
 - Nina Flies.
 - Oh.
 - Oh.
 - It opens up this whole area.
 And the proportion, it changed her.
 - Wow.
 - This time.
 - The five of you represent the best naseché away.
 - And the list goes on and on.
 So it's no surprise when the casting call went out
 for RuPaul's drag race that the tapes came pouring in.
 Let's take a look at some of the colorful queens
 that didn't quite make it into the competition.
 Tomorrow, we leave over behind
 and say goodbye to Tori and Dean
 for a brand new challenge.
 It's requested that you dress to impress,
 decked out in your own best drag.
 - Yes.
 - Woo hoo.
 - Yes, thank you.
 - Kid crew, bring in the cocktails.
 - Yes.
 - It's party time.
 - That's it.
 - Over the years, this campaign has included great duties
 like Pamela Anderson, Linda Evangelista, Christina Aguilera,
 so now I want to see your Viva Glam.
 So you're challenged this week.
 It's a star in your own screen test.
 In title, I am a Mac Viva Glam woman because
 we'll provide you with the studio and the props.
 You'll each have 10 minutes for your Viva Glam screen test
 and Jay, you'll have 15 minutes.
 I want to introduce you to
 Mac's vice president of makeup artistry, Gordon Espiné.
 This is gonna be a really hard one to pick.
 - Well, I'm glad it's up to you.
 And just when you think these queens have gone
 as far as they can go.
 - So I have security.
 - Oh, okay.
 - Into a real life female version of yourself,
 of your drag persona, coming up.
 - And she didn't connect with the material.
 - Thank you.
 - Miss Nina Flowers.
 - Anna Conda, eat your heart out.
 - Charles, come on out here, honey.
 - Now, my dolls, my lovelies.
 As drag mothers, I asked you to share your charisma,
 unique to this nerve and talent with real women.
 And remember girls, no one has immunity
 in tonight's elimination.
 As the competition gets stiffer, the stakes get higher
 and no one is safe.
 Today's challenge is drag on a dime.
 She made it look easy, like going to the toilet.
 - Is it okay?
 Is it, can we see?
 - But there can only be one,
 America's next drag superstar.
 - Coming up, I'm gonna take you on a fast forward tour
 of this past season.
 You told us this was the first outfit you've ever made.
 - Congratulations, you're all safe.
 - I've made my decision.
 - Well, maybe Nina's drag inspiration
 gets lost in translation on a real woman, you know?
 Can we go to Anjina now?
 - I think the total concept, for me, didn't work.
 All right, coming up, you're like a mother, daughter,
 S&M team.
 All right, thank you, Jeffrey.
 - I'm so glad you dropped by.
 - Thank you for having me.
 - Your kiss is darling.
 - Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. On Jina, everybody.
 Coming up, never before seen footage from the green room.
 Plus, some deep dish from our final three.
 Take my love.
 - Kinda remind me of Don Robinson and Envogue, you know?
 - Uh-oh.
 - You know, which is not a good thing.
 - Jade, come on down.
 - Nolan Miller, each a hot house.
 - Take a hot house.
 - Start your engines.
 - You're so young.
 - It's the Bob Mackie.
 - Hey, Roo, you're going to sink you, darling.
 - It's what she--
 - 3D.
 - Good.
 - Yes.
 - I need you to think about how you'd incorporate
 the items from the dollar store.
 - Right.
 - 'Cause that's a really big part of the final score.
 - Wow.
 - Do not accept an apple from this woman.
 - Look, at the heart of every drag queen is a great performer,
 someone with an irrepressible talent,
 that can steal the spotlight,
 even when she's just the third girl from the left.
 This is your chance to show the world
 just what kind of Spice Girl you really are.
 - Ooh.
 - Are you Donna Ross?
 - Oh, hey.
 - For Justice Abree.
 - No!
 - Time will tell.
 - And actions speak louder than words.
 - So are you in charge of the--
 - Okay, girls.
 - Has there ever been a really, really difficult,
 sort of dark period for you in your career?
 - Then there was the time that Chanel
 averted a near juggling wardrobe disaster.
 Category is executive realness 18 through 35.
 Bring it to the ball.
 In the beginning, God created Adam and Eve.
 A few years later,
 Shaniqua, the Garden of Eden's first drag queen,
 came along and stole a pair of pumps from Eve.
 Well, the rest was history.
 Throughout the ages, great women have inspired great drag queens.
 So keep your eyes open and your stilettos high.
 Your drag inspiration may show up
 where you least expect it.
 - Who?
 - I'm blown away.
 - And this Mandarin.
 - Let the music play.
 You bet on work.
 - Very self-dee.
 - Very self-dee.
 - Very self-dee.
 - This extra special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race
 will be right back.
 - You're gonna say that.
 - I saw you first!
 - You and me, I knew you're from Vegas.
 - Let's bring back the girls.
 - It doesn't quite say powerful businesswoman,
 but listen, I trust your interpretation.
 Congratulations, Chanel.
 - I'm talking, you're gonna do each other's makeup.
 - Your engines.
 - Be joyous so that we can all be joyous.
 That's what Diva Glam is really all about.
 - Let them have it, Miss Rebecca.
 What's your excuse?
 Pull it together for the next challenge,
 and you'll be around for the final lap of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 Now come meet me on the runway
 for your next mini challenge, Chanel.
 - You bet on work.
 - Look at me now.
 As the original supermodel of the world,
 I've had all my dreams come true.
 And now it's time for me to share the love.
 - In a moment, one of you will be asked to Chantay,
 which means you can stay.
 And one of you will be asked to sashay away.
 - This is the cover of Drag Race Magazine.
 - Oh, yes, I'm talking about it.
 - That's all that junk and yolk,
 trunk of cajos.
 - That sucks up, baby.
 - Yes.
 - Make a love to the camera.
 - Eat your heart out, Naomi Campbell.
 - What's the greatest information?
 - In terms of the criteria for this challenge,
 Rebecca gave the girl her look.
 - Chanel and--
 - We made it.
 - They were the best.
 - I thought they were the best.
 - Yeah, I agree.
 - Did she look like Chanel?
 - But in between the dishing, the laughter, and the tears,
 our queens took a little time out
 to lend each other some support.
 - When BB dropped that cape, a causa.
 - All right.
 - So you're really reshaping your face.
 - Come on, squirrel friends.
 I've got some nuts for ya.
 - All right, ladies.
 - But there are two of you who really let the rhythm move you
 to now.
 - Well--
 - She was amazing on the runway.
 - She looked great, but I thought
 the look was just a little slonty.
 - I had more issue with wearing that sort of
 "Voice to Men" meets Ashford and Simpson,
 a thing at the interview.
 She has an agenda.
 She wanted to show her outfit.
 - God.
 - It was a pantsuit.
 - It was a pantsuit.
 - Now what about her Viva glam?
 - I loved it.
 - Not a lot of focus here, Victoria.
 - Were you just swept away by the chocolate thunderstorm
 that was in the area?
 - Well, I was kind of having a good time.
 - Another one she popped in that music video.
 - Hey, I'm Jaina.
 - But like a true diva, Chanel turned tragedy into triumph.
 - You asked six questions at one time,
 and that's a really big mistake.
 I have made my decision.
 - Hi, Rebecca.
 - Hi.
 - What you got?
 - Welcome back, girls.
 - Nina Flowers.
 - Following in my footsteps, you were asked to show us
 your Viva glam and to flaunt your unique glamour spirit.
 The girl who wins this challenge
 will become a Viva glam spokesperson.
 - Jaina, you're an inspiration.
 - Thank you.
 - You're a survivor.
 - Congratulations.
 - Sure.
 - Guess again.
 - You're trying so hard to be perfect.
 - Ms. Raspberry Benet.
 - Which I know won't be a problem for most.
 - When I see you, I still see a little boy.
 - Go home.
 - Face, face, face.
 - Surprise.
 - Thank you.
 - Congratulations.
 - We should be eliminated tonight.
 I'd like to see who was an executive
 and who are you basing it on?
 - Thank you.
 - Let's take a look at your Oprah challenge.
 Hello, Raisins, a great drag queen.
 Once said, to whom much is given, much is expected.
 You have a special gift that keeps on giving, lady.
 Drag is part of a sisterhood.
 And starting today, sisters are doing a boom.
 Themself.
 - Now that never happens to Nina.
 I think the person who did the best makeup is
 another impressive week.
 - When it goes to Yoshi.
 - You're in the box.
 - It could be.
 - Well, you want to wear the dress.
 You don't want the dress to wear you.
 - It's peacefulness.
 - We're being a little distracted by Jade's tuck at the time.
 But after admit, looking at it now,
 it's the perfect blend of fashion and attitude.
 It really takes my breath away.
 Here we go again.
 Because you are a winner, baby.
 Rebecca, you started off slow,
 but you turned it out in the end.
 - You're immediately eliminated from this competition.
 - Beyonce.
 - Guess again.
 Good luck in between us.
 What do you think of on China?
 Let's see how they did.
 Nina Flowers.
 - Oh, y'all.
 - Video haul, love video haul.
 - Start your engines.
 - May the best woman win.
 - Cameroon.
 - Our guest judge this week.
 - Bull (beep)
 - And you didn't even need it.
 - M.
 - Well, it's a bold strategy,
 and I hope it pays off for you.
 - Jade, I feel like you're a little stuck.
 - What's your answer?
 (laughing)
 - Now, while you all wait in the interior illusions lounge,
 the judges and I will deliberate.
 Thank you, ladies.
 - I have to be honest.
 Bebe is a fierce competitor,
 but I had the most trouble with her interpretation
 of this challenge.
 - The judges love your style.
 - Tight of a tuck.
 Am I correct in assuming that?
 - Exactly.
 - No.
 - Good luck.
 - Thank you.
 - All right.
 - Wow, the final four.
 You dolls are the cream of the crop.
 Now, it's time to get back to basics.
 Today's mini challenge is a Vogue Off.
 Incredible.
 - I'm done.
 - I'm coming up.
 Woo, get it, girl.
 - And you did it with honesty.
 You know what?
 - Can you get jiggy?
 - And now that, that top-sized link seems a little small
 for a speech sheet.
 - We're done.
 - All right, ladies, switch it around.
 - Okay, let's talk about Anjana.
 I thought she was great, you know.
 - Choreographer is supposed to not make stuff
 like a hot mess.
 They're supposed to have the eye to see and make it tight.
 - And what you think of Rebecca?
 - Though this breaks my heart to say,
 - Ina flowers.
 - And this week, you were the bell of the house ball.
 You turned it out three times.
 Bebe, you're the winner of this challenge.
 Congratulations.
 - Yes, and many Adiva have taken that fall
 and pulled it back up.
 The question is, can she do it tonight?
 - 3D.
 - Hello, hello, hello.
 - Rebecca blew us away when she lip-sinked for her life.
 And it was Chanel's turn to sashay away.
 - True service.
 - This guy's a lip.
 - James, why do you think that you're so guarded?
 - For you to lip-sink intimate,
 never before seen interviews,
 as this extra special edition
 of RuPaul's Drag Race continues.
 - Gentlemen, start your engines.
 The next drag superstar needs to keep in shape.
 - Let the music play.
 - Yes.
 - Guys, thank you for that catwalk down memory lane.
 - I want to see her bring it more.
 I think she's not really going for it.
 What do you think of their choreographer?
 - So beautiful.
 Now it's your turn to give back.
 - Oh, Ina, we're good.
 - Yes, Mommy.
 - Of the week.
 - Charisma.
 - Uniqueness, nerves and a challenge.
 - Hello, races.
 No one liked her outfit.
 - Chanel, you stay.
 Well, thank you all very much.
 This is going to be a very difficult.
 The first time I saw you,
 I thought you could walk away with this competition.
 - What?
 - How do you like my outfit?
 - Oh, yes, Mommy.
 - Let's begin.
 - Rebecca Glasscock.
 - Thank you all.
 - Tighten those tucking panties.
 It's going to be a bumpy ride.
 - Coming up, this is the cover of Drag Race Magazine.
 We're gonna make a love to the camera.
 - Cheers to Cameroon.
 - To Cameroon.
 - Why are you all gagging?
 So she bring it to you every ball.
 - I don't need to tell you.
 Let's move on and let's talk about Rebecca.
 I have to admit, I get mesmerized by her beauty.
 - She's beautiful.
 - Do you think we've let her off the hook too much
 because of it?
 - Yes.
 - Yes, in case you missed it the first time.
 - After like you had been reading
 a teleprompter your whole life.
 - Both of you.
 - This is your last chance to impress me
 and save yourself from elimination.
 You get to choose.
 - Hi Jeffrey.
 - How are you?
 - Good to see you.
 - Good to see you.
 - This means you have immunity for next week's elimination
 and you've also won a Sonos stereo sound system.
 Congratulations, you're still in the race.
 Your rap solo will be featured on my single,
 cover girl, put the bass in your walk.
 - Artist in high heels and lashes
 who've overcome discrimination to express themselves
 while entertaining.
 - Here's the boys.
 They're men.
 You gon' get scared.
 - Prior to tonight you were asked to prepare
 a lip sync performance of one of my favorite songs,
 Shackles by Mary Mary.
 This is your last chance to impress me
 and save yourself from elimination.
 You're young, vulnerable and you come a long way
 in this competition.
 Are you ready?
 - Yep.
 - Ready, ready.
 - This is gonna be fun.
 - Men, start your engines
 and be the best woman, win.
 - I'm looking for the full range of emotions.
 - You're still a long way to go.
 - Congratulations.
 I'll see you dolls next week.
 And remember, you can love yourself.
 How in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?
 Gonna get an amen up in here?
 - Yeah.
 - Naya became BB almost by accident during.
 - Let's take a look at your VivaGlam screen test.
 - Now, were you scared about--
 - No, sash.
 - What if Destin is legendary children?
 You'd be judged as a group and individually.
 So you have to work together
 while finding your own moment in the spotlight.
 - That's a good child.
 - I have made my decision.
 - You are the winner of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 - Congratulations.
 - Well, I just hope you have enough time.
 Break a leg out there.
 - Thank you.
 - Now judges, our queens were asked to make over
 a group of fierce girl fighters in their own drag image.
 This is gonna be a lot of fun.
 Gentlemen, start your engines
 and may the best woman win.
 (laughing)
 Whoo!
 - Her performance, you know,
 below the creamy surface was a package.
 But in the end, whether she was channeling Oprah,
 winning the drag daughter challenge
 or out pummeling the others,
 Rebecca showed she had the guts
 and determination to be a true drag champion.
 Now, Anjina had an aversion to wigs,
 at least on the show, but backstage, honey,
 she couldn't keep her hands off everybody else's.
 Plus, some of the most colorful queens
 who didn't make the cut.
 - Well, girls, now while you wait
 in the interior illusions lounge,
 the judges and I will deliberate.
 Thank you.
 - Lip Sync a song for us.
 - Welcome back to this extra special episode
 of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 This show was all about realness.
 The time has come.
 - Ladies, cameras down.
 - For you to lip sync for your life.
 - Nina Flowers, which means Sweet Pea goes to Miss Chanel.
 - I think you won the Vogueing Challenge.
 Your prize is that you get to assign the fruit flavors.
 (cheering)
 - Oh, you guys are amazing.
 - Aren't they gorgeous?
 - Gorgeous.
 - Now, Mike is here for your first
 official Drag Race photoshoot.
 The judges will be evaluating the photos
 as part of the elimination.
 He'll be shooting you one-on-one.
 Are you ready?
 - Think CEO Diva.
 - And you're really gonna have to step it up.
 - I love this.
 I think this is my favorite one.
 - Rebecca.
 - Ladies, your 30 minutes starts now.
 - All right, squirrel friends, gather around.
 - And for the last time, girls.
 - And you could be the next drag superstar.
 - Chante, you stay.
 - And remember, if you can't love yourself.
 - Get up, all right.
 Let the music play.
 Now it's time for your evaluations.
 Divi will start with you.
 - Divi, Benet.
 - This one.
 - Serving fish.
 - But wait.
 - Merle, what'd you think of this look?
 - Thank you, baby.
 - All right.
 Oh, look at the, the train is on the side scene.
 - I've never seen any of this.
 - I've never seen that either.
 - It's the first trick.
 - Oh, wow.
 - It looks like she's worked on her runway, hasn't she?
 (laughing)
 - Well, hey, dolls.
 (laughing)
 - Whether they're putting it together backstage,
 - I'm gonna have to put my balls behind my freaking eye.
 - Welcome back.
 One of you will be named winner and receive immunity
 in next week's elimination.
 The winner will also receive a three-day stay
 at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada,
 with airfare provided by Southwest Airlines.
 And one of you will leave RuPaul's Drag Race for good.
 So you have immunity, so congratulations,
 you're still in the race.
 - All right, girls, time for us to go.
 But before we do, I have one little bitty twist
 for you involving our challenge.
 - That's right.
 - You know, tell me about what you're doing.
 - You know, we've gone to bat for you
 in this competition time after time.
 And you told me yesterday that the other girls
 have come for you for some reason.
 Do you think that it's this kind of behavior
 that alienates you from the other girls?
 - I've been to flowers, serving drama.
 - And I know you'll take that with you wherever you go.
 - Kiss army.
 - Yes.
 - Yeah.
 - And talent.
 - You added your own personality into it.
 And that's so important.
 - Thank you very much.
 - Mm-hmm.
 (gasps)
 - What are you the most sort of nervous about
 with this competition?
 - I can't hear it.
 ♪ Stroll down the runway ♪
 - The four of you are safe for now.
 - Rebecca Glasscock, ready?
 - Ran out of chances.
 - Thank you, Victoria.
 - Well, dolls, good job.
 Starring fish, let's start with your group.
 We're facing the ultimate challenge.
 - Sashay.
 - Akasha.
 - So, any questions?
 You guys got that?
 - It's got that.
 - It's the last man's standing.
 - No, I'm not sure.
 - Look at you.
 You arrived here all sticky and sweet.
 And now you've been washed clean.
 - Batman's by Ms. Paul.
 (laughs)
 - Now, today's challenge is dragged on a dime.
 - Jade is in the house.
 - Hey.
 - Ooh, you look hot.
 - Let's talk about BB first.
 Okay.
 ♪ I want to be gagging on the extravaganza ♪
 ♪ And eliganza of evening wear ♪
 - Feminine masculine challenge,
 it's more of your ultimate fighter
 out to your drag persona.
 Let's take a look at what Jared looked like before.
 This is your last chance to impress me
 that you won't let us see.
 - What was that look?
 - Banjaina and Akasha.
 You girls really popped in your photo session.
 And that's a good thing.
 Because to your main challenge this week,
 in this competition, you keep tripping up.
 Each group will perform for the judges on the main stage.
 My pit crew will be here shortly with supplies
 from Michael Levine Fabrics
 and Wigs from Renee Paris.
 - Yeah.
 - Run way.
 - Involve the girls in RuPaul's drag race.
 You're the only one who's never had the lip sync for her life.
 Quite an accomplishment.
 Congratulations, Nina.
 May join the other girls and work that runway.
 - Yes.
 - Rebecca Glasscock,
 please join us down here.
 - It's five times MTV award winning director,
 choreographer, Frank Gatson.
 - The time has come.
 (laughing)
 Now, your outfit is exquisite.
 You have made this competition so much better
 by being a part of it.
 - And remember,
 - Let's look at your Viva Glam screen test.
 - Gather around.
 - Help me.
 - Santino is here.
 - Rebecca Glasscock.
 - For the first time,
 you'll see the audition tapes of our contestants.
 - What a tough decision this has been.
 - I already won.
 - To my top three, congratulations.
 Hey, Jared, hey, Anjina, look at you.
 - Oh, she scares me.
 - She scares you, Anjina.
 - Congratulations.
 You're still in the race.
 - Tell me Brown.
 - Bring in some beads so you can put 'em out on stage
 for the other girls, like in showgirls.
 - I will never.
 - To get you up to speed,
 opportunity to pull out all the stops,
 to lip sync for your life.
 - Your time here has come to an end.
 - Please step forward.
 - And this point in the competition,
 I expect things to be a little bit more finished, too.
 - Not exactly.
 - Because it takes her high.
 - Let's talk about Rebecca.
 Now, I was a big fan of this.
 First of all, I have to say,
 the girl that she chose,
 I really didn't think she could turn it out like that.
 - I was so surprised.
 - RuPaul's Drag Race is about to get real.
 - Can you kneel, please?
 - In three, two.
 - Drag queens love to show off what we've got.
 So almost every audition tape included Chanel.
 - All right.
 - La, and our guest judge this week
 is celebrity photographer, Mike Ruiz.
 - Hey, Ru.
 - And our extra special surprise guest judge this week.
 A living legend.
 - Welcome one of my idols.
 - Thank you for having lunch with me.
 - Oh, you're welcome.
 - Thank you for having me.
 - To do something else I am so I couldn't eat another bite.
 Thank you, Rebecca.
 - You're welcome, thank you.
 - I want one in every color.
 - Thank you.
 - Now, sashay away from elimination.
 - When?
 - To win this competition,
 you're gonna need to be more enterprising
 than Donald Trump to give bigger than Oprah
 and to be harder than Tyra,
 wearing a fat suit in July.
 - I wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart.
 - You know, even though I'm sorry
 and I want you to know how glad I am.
 I met you.
 I hope you take this experience back home with you
 and continue to do what you do best.
 - I was wearing a fabulous designer
 everyone should know about Zaldi.
 All six outfits were done by Zaldi.
 He is amazing.
 He's done most of my costumes.
 - And he designed them.
 - Oh, he took it.
 - You're really breathtaking,
 but from the waist down, you're a little stiff.
 - Let's take a look at your Oprah challenge.
 - I can only imagine how hard he is.
 - Bibi, la beisha.
 Bibi, la beisha.
 - Who's that girl?
 Temple, are you amazed by that?
 - Yes.
 - Thank you.
 - Ooh, wow.
 You are the winner of this challenge.
 - By after this, I can go.
 - You are a legendary queen
 and I cannot tell you how happy I am to have you here.
 - Thank you, judges.
 Now, as you know, there is no immunity this week,
 but you have won a custom-made dress
 from Miami Elite Designs.
 You're safe and you've made it
 to the final lap of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 Congratulations.
 We'll lose and from that group.
 - Welcome back to this extra special episode
 of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 Now, each week, while the judges and I deliberated,
 the girls waited in the interior illusions lounge.
 Feet were sore, eagles were bruised,
 and that's when (beep) would hit the fan.
 And the strain began to show right from day one.
 I need a moment alone.
 Mia is going to, but I have to give her props
 for becoming more feminine.
 She covered upper tats.
 Yes, it's very, very Betty Davis.
 Don't (beep) it up.
 The time has come.
 You know, my sisterhood of the traveling panty-girdles.
 Now, I want you all to meet a talented group
 of Girl Fighters.
 Don't (beep) this mango.
 Maybe that's Bebe called Chanel.
 Yes, yes, yes, yeah.
 Chanel, Chante, you stay.
 Well, at the end of the day,
 the judges are going to be looking to you
 as their leader, though.
 Thank you, Chanel.
 Thank you, Sweet Pea.
 I'm looking for America's next drag superstar.
 Because behind their fabulous faces and fierce facades,
 there's a whole lot of heart and soul you've never seen.
 Yes, because you feature the back door a lot.
 Yes, I do, yeah, I do.
 You have to use the skills to what?
 But not all the realness made it to the screen.
 I have made my decision.
 Next, sad news.
 Cher just announced that she's retiring for real.
 Well, there you have it.
 The fabulous final three, my girls.
 She lets you have it.
 One of you will be eliminated.
 You didn't come close.
 Hey, Michelle.
 Hey, baby.
 No money, but a big imagination, and turning it out.
 She was letting these children have it.
 All right, here we are at last.
 And what beauty tips did you learn
 that you could apply it to your everyday life?
 You're really coming into your own.
 Thank you so much.
 Are you much now?
 Don't, fuck it up.
 Some audition tapes were quirky,
 but Tami Brown screamed quirky with a capital Q.
 That's really well.
 Phoebe, you are a moving piece of art.
 Madam Cameroon, you may join the others.
 She is the sunshine shade.
 One of the things that the judges are going to be looking for
 is how well you did with the costumes.
 Are you concerned that you're not really taking care?
 Her medusa look.
 What?
 Yes.
 So we are down.
 Congratulations on making it to week two of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 But this is no time to relax and untuck.
 You know, drag is about a lot of things.
 Perfect outfit, perfect makeup, the perfect wig.
 But at the end of the day, it's what's going on inside
 that really counts.
 You all are sisters.
 Congratulations, you're still in the race.
 And do we think that Phoebe delivers?
 Has she brought it to the main stage?
 If one of you has to go, contender, good luck?
 Thashe away.
 Competition!
 Wherever you go.
 My little, up and down.
 Coming legendary children.
 Hi Chanel.
 Hi.
 How are you, darling?
 This is your car.
 You're a makeover partner.
 Ooh.
 How's it going?
 You're going to form two rival girl groups.
 You'll take turns choosing your team.
 One will be in charge of choreography.
 Well, the following girls.
 I couldn't love them more if I had hired a surrogate
 to carry them for me.
 And don't-- oh, wow.
 See, now, you're also just naturally beautiful.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Drag queens have continued to push the envelope
 and use their size 13 pumps to prop the door open
 for a new generation of drag performers.
 I'm talking about legends.
 You can start again.
 You have time.
 You have time, honey.
 Thashe.
 Phoebe, you are the winner of this week's challenge, Chanel.
 Akasha, the time has come to lip sync for your life.
 An intimate inside dish from our final three.
 And that is really what drags all about.
 So taking what you've got, Lucy Lawless,
 you can relate to Mia here.
 She looks like a warrior princess.
 She's got charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent to spare.
 Gentlemen, start your engines and may the best woman win.
 Yeah, what?
 And remember.
 And she's applying her runway technique
 that she learned a few weeks back.
 Let's bring the girls.
 There are actually two winners to this challenge.
 And the second winner is--
 I'm going to do what I'm going to do.
 Dolls, are you ready?
 Yes.
 All right.
 This means you will have immunity next week.
 And remember, in addition to looking beautiful is Chanel.
 And you want them to clean it every bit of it.
 My fear with Tammy is that she did not connect with us.
 All right, ladies, time is up.
 Rebecca, step away from the subject.
 Neenaflowers did well.
 I mean, her personality.
 Somehow, I believe you can do it.
 You have shown such stick with it
 throughout this competition that I believe in you.
 This is Akasha.
 Wow.
 I've never seen her in so many clothes.
 Exactly.
 East meets West.
 Hi.
 Let's thank Tori and Dean for being such great sports.
 It's our pleasure.
 You guys are here.
 With Chanel, I always see a lot of this.
 But what I want to see is this and this listening.
 Yeah.
 Thousands apply, but only nine have been invited
 to compete for the crown.
 Wow, I love that color.
 Combination.
 Start your engines and make the best woman.
 For you, India, your evening gown presentation.
 Congratulations, ladies.
 I'll see you next week.
 And I can't wait to see what's going to happen.
 Do it by yourself right now.
 Now, you've seen her gorgeous gowns,
 her startling transformations, her incredible hair.
 But who is the queen behind the doll?
 Hide your board because you don't want the shady queen
 next to you copying your answers.
 It's sort of straddling.
 I think these girls know how to straddle away.
 And if you can't take the heat, that's not going to work.
 So to go out there and to take on, oh, they don't like me,
 or nobody said how beautiful I am, well, you know what?
 It's a given.
 She's gorgeous.
 Camera's off.
 You know, yeah.
 One of you, Tashante.
 So you are group leader Akasha and in charge of makeup.
 This is true.
 Are you worried that everybody's really on their own path?
 Do you feel like you're really leading them?
 And we're running out of time.
 Especially for me.
 Absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 Gorgeous.
 I want to welcome my regular judges first.
 Fashion journalist and best selling author, Merle Ginsburg.
 This might be a recipe for us.
 Congratulations.
 You're still in the race.
 TV Michelle.
 Tonight, my two best girls are going to lip sync.
 My new single, cover girl, put the base in your walk.
 This is your very last chance to impress me
 and walk away with the prize.
 The next drag superstar.
 How's it going?
 You seem a little defeated.
 Don't forget, the judges will be looking for your charisma,
 uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
 Mama said no.
 Now you can also use the guys.
 Rebecca.
 More drama, more secrets, and more eye-popping beauty
 than you can stand, honey.
 Because when it comes to RuPaul's drag race,
 too much is never enough.
 I have to excuse myself.
 My two superpowers.
 I'm not talking kai kai.
 Ladies, next question.
 Which Mark's brother got his nickname from being a harpist?
 I mean, each week, it was like a new episode of It Came
 From Planet Nina.
 Good job.
 I cannot wait to see who made the list.
 One really stood out above the rest.
 On China, you are the winner of this challenge.
 You're a special and unique performer.
 But this competition got the better of you.
 And you really do have the potential to make it happen.
 Akasha, you are the winner of this week's challenge.
 Are you ladies ready?
 Your personality is just really lovely.
 You are safe this week.
 Congratulations.
 You're safe.
 We're down to two dolls.
 My baby.
 You're still growing.
 Gentlemen.
 Jay.
 You've made it to the final lap of RuPaul's drag race.
 Hey, Josh.
 Face, honey.
 And I want you all to yell out the answer this time.
 What do all these things have in common?
 They had to create looks based on absolute vodka flavors.
 Now, for those who didn't really sew,
 it seemed like meltdown time.
 Oh, Rebecca.
 And baby, you are still in the race.
 Thank you.
 I love you, sweetheart.
 You may join the others.
 Fabulousness.
 Of course, pursuing a life of drag can be challenging.
 Barely.
 But some girls seem extra sensitive about the tucking issue.
 Pearl, what do you think would start with, uh, on China?
 Deborah?
 I call her little black punk tour.
 Uh-huh.
 I like her a lot.
 She was a little stiff initially, but she's very likable.
 Yes.
 Your 30 minutes starts now.
 As part of your presentation on the main stage,
 let's talk about a caution away.
 And may the best woman win.
 But to your credit.
 Ready.
 Gentlemen, start your engines.
 And may the best woman win.
 Taking it to the next level, the ultimate level, the very top.
 30 seconds left.
 OK, OK.
 Time is up.
 Now, Michelle, do you know a thing or two about being in a girl
 grub down here?
 Yes.
 Welcome back.
 That means Gail is the correct answer on China.
 Week after week, your vulnerability.
 She's like, are you ready for your face?
 Yes.
 Away.
 Ooh.
 Your face for the world to see.
 All right.
 Just between us, Gail.
 Welcome, Gail.
 How are you?
 Of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 Let's talk about Ms. BB Blue.
 Coming up, my pals, Merle and Santino,
 stopped by to share the top 10 most unforgettable fashion
 moments.
 And later, never before seeing footage that
 will slap you right upside your hand.
 There was mistake.
 This extra special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race
 will be right back.
 Hello.
 You are serving Africa.
 You are serving the Lion Queen.
 You are really a star out there, like Diana Ross.
 You were the boss.
 Thank you, Merle.
 Your personality is just really lovely.
 You're kind of quiet and unassuming and approachable.
 But the moment you step onto that stage,
 girl, you pummel this mother [BLEEP]
 something every real woman should know.
 So you should make use of your Mac makeup kits, supplies
 from Michael Levine Fabrics, and shoes from Kitson LA.
 Now, Rebecca, you won the workout challenge.
 As your reward, every week you saw
 our contestants face criticism from the judges.
 But little did we know that when they were in the green room--
 Congratulations.
 So we are.
 BB, tell me exactly why is a woman
 supposed to do a half-month?
 Of all of you.
 Look at that brack.
 She's going to put somebody's eyes out with those things.
 And tonight, life is a celebration.
 But the final decision is mine to make.
 Prior to tonight, you were asked to prepare a lip sync
 performance of a song that is near and dear to my heart
 and is paying the mortgage on several homes
 around the world.
 This is it, girls.
 OK, pit crew, bring in the cameras.
 But it's not your time yet.
 Miss Raspberry?
 Long away.
 All right, Nina, coming up.
 This is your last chance to impress me and save yourself
 your-- ooh, matchmaker.
 Thank you, Chanel.
 Rebecca, our resident Barbie doll, gorgeous.
 All right, next question.
 The judges were wild time and time again.
 Utterly original.
 I've consulted with the judges, my lawyers, and housekeeper.
 Thank you.
 Let's begin.
 You represent two different stages of drag.
 And each of you has something that the other lacks.
 Now, the judges are going to be looking
 to see how clever you are and how
 you accessorize with your real fruit.
 Up next.
 You need this.
 African girl.
 Wow.
 OK.
 Your mission.
 Congratulations.
 You pulled off a very difficult challenge.
 Cameroon.
 Let's don't be shy.
 Yes.
 We'll be the winner.
 Next episode of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
 I'm rolling with a new pit crew.
 Come on.
 Come on.
 I got you, Greg.
 You are the winner of this week's challenge.
 Start your engines.
 Let the music play.
 Now, this is the final stage of this challenge.
 And the last queen standing wins this challenge.
 Chanel, are you ready?
 Are you ready, my dear?
 I am ready.
 We're not sweating.
 Adios.
 Adios.
 Here's a fast forward recap of this season.
 Is it Yoji or is it Sonya Ricchio?
 It's a little bit above.
 I bet you say that to all the host of shows that you're on.
 You also win a big basket of chocolates and sparkling wine
 from Karma and Vozho Chocolat.
 Thank you.
 Oh, so now I'm going to write you a ticket, girl.
 Yeah, a melden.
 Gentlemen, start your engines.
 And be the best woman.
 Win, win.
 The time has come for you to lip sync for your life.
 For your life.
 For your life.
 And remember--
 And don't.
 F*ck it up.
 Don't f*ck it up.
 Don't f*ck it up.
 I have two words for you.
 Win.
 Exchabagandza, elagandza.
 Elagandza, opulence.
 You own everything.
 And one contestant's native land
 inspired me like none other.
 Say it with me.
 Oh, yes, f*ck it up.
 Last but not least, Jade.
 Your look is gorgeous.
 I was just a little bit worried about your tuck there.
 It's just a little distracting, that's all.
 Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
 Well, it's interesting to see such a beautiful woman
 with such a huge--
 I want to see some poppins, some dipping, and some spinning.
 That's right.
 Bring it to the ball.
 Representing the house of Cameroon.
 Phoebe, you're up first.
 Popping, dipping, spinning, mean of flowers.
 All right, kiddo, we've seen your music video performances,
 and we've evaluated your experience here on "The Drag Race."
 Now, while you all wait in the interior illusions lounge,
 the judges and I will deliberate.
 It was very impressed, although when I see you,
 I still see a little boy.
 I'd love to see more of a little lady.
 Welcome, girls.
 You all look amazing.
 So I just expect my girls to show up 100% when we're working,
 you know, and how you did on your Oprah challenge.
 I am scared of you, queen.
 Thank you so much for the--
 Now, throughout the competition,
 the judges have sort of gotten on you
 about being a little more real out.
 And where are you going to sort of reveal more of you?
 My natural color.
 Rebecca.
 Now, you can wear your own wigs, hills, and undergarments.
 And as far as makeup is concerned, Mac has that cover.
 I've made my decision.
 Hi, Rebecca.
 Hi.
 Give me J-Lo, honey.
 Yes, mom.
 They used those props.
 Use that hose, honey.
 Ooh, ooh.
 Pull up to the bumpa, honey.
 Beautiful.
 You know, I wish I had a drag daughter.
 I mean, you guys are all my daughters,
 but I don't really get to dress you up.
 In the end, baby, turn the tide.
 Baby, you're the winner of this challenge.
 And Chanel made a request that shocked the nation.
 I don't want to be here anymore.
 How much wood could a wood chuck chop?
 Oh, well, since you are here, I have a little question for you.
 OK.
 As a former competitor, who do you think
 has the best chance of winning?
 It's your potential that's kept you here.
 Well, let's move on to Anjaina.
 I thought her screen test was absolutely fabulous.
 No, walk.
 Is it the Donut 50?
 All right.
 Nina Flowers, Viva Glam screen test.
 10 minutes, start now.
 OK.
 You're still in the race.
 I'm about to introduce you to Bill Tammy.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Miss Tammy Brown's in town.
 Miss Mango.
 So I was surprised for you.
 Victoria.
 Victoria.
 Oh, well, judges, we are at a whole new level now.
 Chanel, if you can't love yourself.
 Madam, I'm a sita.
 What's up, boys?
 Hey, Chanel, you forgot the back of your outfit.
 They were half off.
 I had to have--
 Oh, I see.
 [LAUGHTER]
 How beautiful are you, girls?
 It is my pleasure to have you all here at Group Hall's Drag Race.
 You come from all around this great country.
 And thanks to Southwest Airlines,
 you arrived here, safe and sound, to compete for the crown.
 All right, Chanel, your face for the world to see.
 The next day on the runway, there were thrills, chills,
 and spills.
 Viva won the all-important immunity,
 but disaster struck when Akasha and Chanel
 had the lip sync for their lives.
 Thank you, Nina Flowers.
 Viva, please step forward.
 Welcome, dolls.
 And congratulations again for making it to the finals.
 One of you is about to become one lucky lady.
 Since all three of you did such a fabulous job,
 each of you will appear in the final video.
 As my special co-stars, this is beautiful.
 This is Jane.
 The winner of Group Hall's Drag Race
 is going to be one lucky lady.
 OK.
 Now that you've seen some of the queens that didn't make it
 to Group Hall's Drag Race, let's take a peek
 at the audition tapes of the ones you did.
 And, Jaina, you're the winner of this challenge.
 Start your engines.
 Now, Michelle is going to be your extra special guest
 judge tomorrow.
 Great things from you.
 And you're going to teach them how.
 Ms. Citron, for this category, you'll
 be allowed to use your own wardrobe or start from scratch.
 And the final category is evening gown for you to lip sync.
 So I've got one more question.
 Today's mini challenge is all about self-expression.
 I'll call out several scenarios.
 And each time I do, you must strike a pose
 and take a picture of yourself.
 Rebecca?
 Plus a cash prize of $20,000, courtesy of absolute vodka
 and matte cosmetics.
 All right, darling, I'm going to let you get back to work.
 Nina Flowers.
 Hi.
 Ms. Mango.
 Ms. Mango.
 Now, you are very proficient at using that sewing machine,
 aren't you?
 No, no making ogles.
 And seriously, girls, don't [BLEEP] it up.
 Usually, I say more is more.
 But with this challenge, you kept it simple.
 And it worked.
 Your girl fighter looked pretty and real.
 In other words, the perfect translation
 of your drag persona.
 And it was a cautious turn to sashay away.
 Line up.
 Let me see your faces.
 Anybody who can step out of the house
 with a pair of high heels and some lipstick on their lips
 is my hero.
 No matter what happens tonight, you will carry on.
 You will be fine queens.
 Prior to tonight, you are asked to prepare a lip sync
 performance of Michelle Williams' hit song, We Break the Dawn.
 Now, you're raspberry, right, baby?
 You're charisma.
 You're still in the race.
 You can join the others.
 Yes, again.
 Opulence.
 You own everything.
 Cameroon.
 But to prove that you can be the next drag superstar.
 If you can--
 Neenaflowers, you won this challenge.
 Neenaflowers has gone back to her roots.
 Gentlemen, start your engines.
 And may the best woman win.
 Coming up, show them strength and power.
 It's very feature photo spread in Paper Magazine.
 In my opinion, every great television show
 has a catch phrase.
 Time is up.
 But after that, your outfit needs to be--
 no, yes.
 Dirty cars.
 Who do you choose?
 You're so good.
 Looks good.
 It looks really, really good.
 She can't do that nose down.
 I would go out like this.
 You also get to pair up all the other teams.
 I don't know you as a--
 I'm kidding.
 Chanel, you'll be changed with "On China."
 Glamorous, seasoned, showgirl Chanel.
 No, Jay.
 The time has come.
 So let the cow down begin.
 Are you sure?
 Gather around, girls.
 Gather around, listen up.
 All right, ladies, you came from the brink of elimination.
 But you know what I really loved about these girls?
 They were just as hard on themselves as they were on us.
 And that's what they're judging you on.
 "On China's team sailed through.
 But Akasha's team got panned, and so did Akasha."
 Jay.
 But when it's all over, gentlemen, start your engines.
 And I want you to know right now, Chanel, you are beautiful.
 At the end, we had our first winner, Mina Flowers.
 You are the winner of this week's challenge.
 Thank you so much, Jay.
 Baby, what advice would you give to Rebecca?
 Table for two.
 That's a golly old.
 Sorry.
 Aside from that, let's take a look and see what would happen.
 Ladies, here's tomorrow on the main stage.
 Make me proud.
 And remember, your image is so strong,
 I'd love to see a softer side of Ms. Flowers.
 I want to see the flower.
 Tonight, on an extra special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race,
 as the final three queens, Mina, Bebe, and Rebecca
 prepared a badlet out for the title of America's Next Drag
 Superstar.
 It's time to shift gears and take a look back at this season's
 highlights and lowlights.
 The judges will be looking for--
 [GROANING]
 The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race will also
 receive a gift certificate worth $2,500 from Luma Diamond
 Consultants and a selection of designer sunglasses from LAI
 Works.
 And she will receive $5,000 worth of Mac makeup.
 Bebe, you're up first.
 I love this dress.
 And now, tell us a little bit about your experience
 making the video.
 No, she did it.
 No, you did it.
 Oh, no, she did not.
 She's a leopard queen.
 Not only is Bebe carrying all of Africa on her shoulders,
 she's carrying all of Renee of Paris wigs on her head.
 Rebecca took a lot of hits from her competitors today.
 I'm in your bets why she said all these bitches need to be.
 Y'all got it.
 Shannell, you asked six questions at one time,
 which means the interviewer isn't listening.
 And that's a really big mistake to make.
 And the outfit did not fit.
 Mom, I'm a track queen.
 Hey, racers, as I speak, Paris is burning.
 Lindsay is dehydrated, Britney's ordering from a drive-thru.
 And Paula is just laying tired.
 You are.
 You are.
 That sounds so nice to hear.
 It's true.
 And I'm sorry I thought I told you earlier.
 I really did.
 I would not like you to leave.
 You are a great--
 only one of you can drive away with the fierce title
 of America's next breakthrough drag superstar.
 Thank you, Shannell.
 You're great, isn't it?
 I believe you can do it.
 I can exactly it all.
 Bebe, your style is so bold that it was difficult
 to translate to a real woman, but you did pull it off.
 You have brought so much to this competition.
 Your time will come.
 Please take one step forward away.
 This is just head to toe, bowl, show-stopping glam.
 I'm getting all worked up up in here.
 Who's next?
 Anjaina, Jenny, what do you think of Anjaina's presentation
 tonight?
 Anjaina, let's do 10 minutes starting.
 So today, for your mini challenge,
 these girl fighters are going to give you a full force workout.
 In the end, the last queen standing.
 And be the best woman.
 Win!
 Oh, my.
 OK, bring it.
 That is Shannell.
 Now, Nina, and don't [BLEEP] it up.
 This temple.
 Temple.
 You're still finding your voice.
 All right, deliberations.
 You keep going, and I keep going.
 Girl.
 You're still in the race, serving fish.
 Now, one queen who was not afraid to speak her mind
 was Mr. Kaush.
 I know her.
 It seems that Bebe really nailed this competition.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Their history is our history.
 Don't forget, it was a drag queen
 that threw the first brick that started the Stonewall
 riots and ignited the gay liberation movement.
 You've really morphed into so many different personalities.
 It's amazing.
 I just plug it in and blow.
 I can't talk right now, this is so--
 Stay open to criticism.
 [LAUGHS]
 All right, I can make it all right.
 You girls really showed me some moves today.
 Miss Tammy Brown is making a gown.
 Yes, Miss RuPaul.
 The winner of the challenge is--
 Hey, I'm backstage at RuPaul's Drag Race.
 Next week, we're going to make history.
 As we choose America's next drag superstar.
 Now, that's some change we can believe in, honey.
 And speaking of history, our contestants
 stand on the shoulders of those who came before them.
 Queens who had something special to share with the world,
 even when the world wasn't ready to receive it.
 It's illegal in this state of caution.
 It's not how I would do my face.
 If you had to do it, it would work.
 All right.
 Phoebe, in an absolute world, why should you win?
 When the final four regrouped, their mini challenge
 recalled the great drag balls of history.
 Today's mini challenge is a vogue off for your life.
 I've made my decision.
 Impersonation.
 Impersonation.
 Good evening and welcome to the main stage
 of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 I like to say hi to my judges, fashion journalist,
 and best-selling author, Murgensburg, the shamelessly outspoken
 designer, Santino.
 And our guest judge this week is one of Hollywood's top media
 consultants.
 Please welcome Howard Braggman.
 Thanks, Ru.
 And actress, comedian, and from her eight seasons
 on MAT-TV, the world's foremost Oprah impersonator,
 Deborah Wilson-Skelton, portrait taken
 by renowned photographer, Greg Gorman,
 to be used in an LA I-Works legendary designer
 I-Ware campaign.
 And the winner will headline the absolute vodka
 pride tour across the US.
 Yeah.
 Mommy Dearest.
 Yes it is.
 The time has come.
 Don't [BLEEP] it up.
 Elimination.
 And let us have that killer body.
 Lay.
 Watch out for that hoes, Nina.
 [LAUGHS]
 Yeah, boo.
 We got our color.
 [CHEERING]
 Yeah.
 And I love, love, love.
 If you can't love yourself, for you,
 it's only going to be the beginning.
 Answer that question.
 And you've got this one in the bag, baby.
 We are so excited you're here.
 Ladies, congratulations.
 And remember, if you can't love yourself,
 I have made my decision.
 You took a risk, and it paid off,
 especially when it came to the share thing.
 We're all share fans.
 And you were happy that share was retiring.
 Let's see her before photo.
 Wow.
 Finally came the interview with the adorable Torian Dean.
 Only basically we are all family.
 Uniqueness, nerves, and talents.
 Again, Tina.
 In the house of absolute.
 It's like a Las Vegas showgirl.
 It's always flawless.
 In a way, you are almost too flawless.
 It's got an edge of theme park going on there, too.
 There has to be some vulnerability.
 And I haven't seen much vulnerability with you.
 OK?
 Now, let's take a look.
 Yes.
 Wow.
 Your whole presentation was really powerful,
 dressing in that beautiful outfit.
 Coming up, one of you will leave RuPaul's Drag Race.
 Our guest judge this week is Max VP of Makeup Artistry.
 Gordon Espiné, our extra special guest judge this week,
 is supermodel and actress Jenny Shimizu.
 Gentlemen?
 For the evening gown competition,
 the good folks at Marco Marco are here
 to lend you a helping hand.
 Supermodel, this is your last chance
 to impress me and to save yourself from elimination.
 OK.
 Thank you.
 You may join the other girls.
 Now, the song I've chosen for them to perform
 is Drumroll Rebecca.
 Phoebe, we are doing Oprah.
 Hi, Ruang Shanti.
 Where are you drawing your Oprah inspiration from?
 House of Flowers!
 [APPLAUSE]
 You felt great to win.
 Mean of Flowers, you've won this challenge.
 And you'll find out what your prize is in a few minutes.
 Thank you.
 Please welcome an all-around entertainer.
 Yes.
 Something to wash down the fava beans.
 Yes.
 And it's the song.
 Hello, hello, hello.
 Hey, ladies.
 Not different.
 Nice.
 Yeah, it's a little pale.
 You're still gorgeous.
 I love the lipstick.
 Yeah, well, Nina has working for her personality.
 And whatever obstacle she faces with the language barrier,
 she overcomes it with her genuine sweetness.
 And she's got a real sense of what her body can do
 and what she can get away with.
 Now, last.
 This is the last one.
 Oprah has many faces, but she doesn't have a mustache.
 Are you going to have time to shake?
 Which says, I'm really interested in what you have to say.
 And tell me what you really think.
 Thank you guys so much.
 Over.
 Oh, oh, oh.
 This ain't no truck stop, honey.
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, Mama.
 Oh, I'm trying to do it.
 The half left.
 Well, look at you.
 Ru-ball.
 That's right.
 So get ready for the music that will make the bourgeoisie
 and the rebel come together.
 And it shows.
 And if one of us is in pain, we are all in pain.
 We are all in trouble.
 So let's-- it's going to be a jailbreak, honey.
 We call her bubble guns, because she liked the pop a lot.
 Throw down the runway.
 Ever, ever, ever.
 From elimination.
 That was--
 Thank you.
 So girls, now I have to ask you each.
 The winner of Ru-Paul's Drag Race
 will receive a feature photo spread in Paper Magazine,
 a portrait taken by renowned photographer
 Greg Gorman for the LAIWorks Legendary Designer
 Eyewear Campaign, a headline spot
 on the Absolute Pride Tour across the USA,
 plus a cash prize of $20,000, courtesy of Absolute Vodka,
 and Matt Cosmetics.
 So you think you know who we're going to be sending home?
 Uh, yeah.
 Ru-Paul's Drag Race has just begun.
 No.
 I love a good gun.
 On the first day, the car wash photo shoot
 tested the girl's ability to shine under pressure.
 The challenge this week is drag on a dime.
 Yes, I will.
 I'm so excited to just drag.
 Now, enough talk.
 Oh, my goodness.
 Is that what you're the most nervous about?
 Is your soulmanship?
 Can I get an amen in here?
 All right, let the music play.
 OK, I have a feeling that there's no way
 you can really make it that-- that--
 All right, dolls, gather around my lovelies.
 I've got a little announcement to make.
 Come on over.
 Good evening, and welcome to the main stage
 of Ru-Paul's Drag Race.
 As always, I'd like to say hello to my fabulous judges.
 First, fashion journalist and best-selling author,
 Merle Ginsburg.
 And hello to my pal, the shamelessly outspoken designer
 who's no stranger to the runway.
 Santino.
 Wash her.
 And save yourself.
 Amazing, amazing.
 But you know what?
 A class shop will be set home.
 All the area has been--
 Chicago.
 Looks like everyone got it correct.
 Hey!
 Hina.
 But at the same time, it was Mia Farrow in the great gas.
 I yelled at her a lot.
 I have made my decision.
 A closet tour.
 They were-- you're still in the race.
 And don't.
 So dolls, in addition to making this the hottest
 house ball in history--
 Well, welcome to another fun-filled week on Ru-Paul's Drag Race.
 The competition is getting ferocious.
 And you guys have gotten so much criticism,
 constructive criticism, from me and the judges.
 But we haven't heard what you all have to say about each other.
 Rebecca.
 The time has come for you to lip sync for your life.
 You know, eat your tic-tac and you will celebrate.
 It's all about pop music.
 Hi, ladies.
 Hi.
 And humor.
 Hi, Chris.
 What did Nina teach you about the runway?
 What tips?
 Very good.
 I am really looking forward to seeing Miss Nina and Miss Mia
 on that runway tomorrow.
 Thank you very much.
 Well, you don't know anything, because it's my decision.
 Uniqueness?
 Ah, look at those bows.
 You know, Nina's look may have been severe.
 But her audition tape was simple, direct, and from the heart.
 Don't [BLEEP] it up.
 OK, ladies.
 And while we contemplate who should stay,
 you all wait in the interior illusions lounge.
 And if you have a killer body, do not be afraid to show it off.
 One group, Rebecca.
 [LAUGHS]
 So remember, and the worst, is it up.
 This decision, there's this real sweetness that comes from you
 that has been surprising from everyone,
 because your look is so severe, you know?
 So gorgeous.
 Yes.
 And--
 Action.
 Tell me about your HIV/H?
 You have HIV.
 Your contribution to the world of drag is undeniable.
 Oh, yes.
 I remember this one.
 Very Valley of the Dolls.
 So Nina, because when it comes to Oprah--
 Chante, you stay.
 Nina is Miss Mango.
 [CHEERING]
 Big ad.
 She proved that big drag queens and big hearts go together.
 And you did run out of time.
 Each girl was given 10 minutes.
 And there was no modeling.
 Could have been better.
 Thank you, Chanel.
 Your personal style is not evolving from week to week.
 I love the whole Mohawk thing.
 I have to give her props for becoming more feminine.
 Her personality is shined through.
 She always surprises us.
 You, angina, is confidence and energy.
 And that is beautiful.
 And I had to tell pork chop to sashay away.
 Continue to do what you do best and inspire the children.
 I've made my decision.
 This is your last chance to impress me
 and save yourself from elimination.
 Maroon!
 But the one contestant that gave me a run for my money
 was Nina.
 Mac donates 100% of the sales of this product
 to help people living with HIV and AIDS.
 Don't forget the judges will be looking for your charisma,
 uniqueness, nerve, momentarily, Rebecca.
 Well, thank you, baby.
 Thank you, Michelle.
 Who should it be?
 Gentlemen, start your engines.
 And may the best woman win.
 So we are down to two queens.
 I am.
 Is to make over your girl fighter partner.
 Congratulations.
 You're still in the race.
 Tonight, the decision has been made for me.
 Akasha?
 Congratulations.
 You're still in the race.
 I'm about to introduce you to your guest judge.
 Wait.
 Take it away, mama.
 You have 15 minutes.
 That's a long time.
 OK.
 That's fair.
 Yeah, you know, Akasha was a team leader,
 and she didn't seem very in charge.
 And that worries me.
 What did you think of Beep-Beep?
 She totally understood the choreography.
 Illness.
 He said he never shared the stage at the same time.
 You know, I would love to have seen them together.
 Good work, angels.
 She saved the best for last.
 No, she saved the best for now.
 Yes, she did.
 Oh, wow.
 Is she throwing shaders at just her eyelashes?
 Sell the garment, honey.
 What flavor?
 Are you ready for the ride of your life?
 Akasha, come on out, girl.
 For the first drag on a dime challenge,
 the girls pull their looks together
 and plunge into their first runway competition.
 We saw beauty, workiness, sluddiness, and a few drag faux pas.
 Oh, no, no, no, no.
 Freaking dress by Beyonce.
 One of you will win this challenge.
 Hey, surprise, everybody.
 Look who's here on China.
 Kiss, kiss, mwah, mwah, mwah, darling.
 Hello.
 Now, you're not here seeking revenge, are you?
 No, I forgot my blade in the car, so no revenge today.
 Wow, look what we got here.
 Just checking in.
 Boy, look at that.
 Tina Marie, eat your heart out.
 I love that you like to show off your body.
 I do.
 You're not afraid of that, are you?
 No.
 Tell us what's going on.
 Story telling.
 You were very nervous.
 I could tell.
 You're very nervous.
 You were rushed.
 Your outfit wasn't newsworthy.
 That's for sure.
 For good, because--
 Who's number one?
 Now, this is your last chance to impress me
 and save yourself from elimination.
 My admiration with you.
 Ellen, she's gorgeous.
 Yes.
 Hello, Nina.
 Hi.
 Why should you win RuPaul's Drag Race?
 For you to lip sync for your life.
 Good luck.
 Wow.
 All right, Nina, who should be eliminated tonight?
 Rebecca.
 Well, thank you.
 Welcome back, ladies.
 See you a little bit more creativity.
 How are you doing, Ru?
 Hi, darling.
 Good to see you again.
 And our extra special guest judge this week
 is singer, songwriter, and one
 of Destiny's chosen children.
 Please welcome Michelle Williams.
 When?
 Santino, what do you think?
 Grace Jones.
 In the Wizard of Oz, what is Dorothy's last name?
 Now, baby, usually you are so flawless.
 But with this challenge, you underwhelmed us.
 Not to mention that your girl fighters' look
 didn't come close to matching your own.
 You're in the bottom, too.
 Do, do, do.
 Hey, Chanel, what are you doing?
 What's up, everybody?
 Oh, that is darn tasty.
 Raspberry never looked so good.
 I'd like to say hi to my fabulous judges.
 Fashion, journalist, and best-selling author, Merle Ginsburg.
 Loving the roux in blue.
 Thank you, darling.
 The shamelessly outspoken designer, Santino.
 If I were you, I would--
 I would-- I'm Emma.
 Welcome back to this extra special edition
 of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 In just one week, either BB, Rebecca, or Nina,
 will walk away with the title of America's Next Drag Superstar.
 The winner will also receive a feature photo spread
 in Paper Magazine, a portrait taken by renowned photographer
 Greg Gorman for the LA iWorks Legendary Designer
 Eyewear Campaign, a headline spot
 on the absolute pride tour across the USA,
 plus a cash prize of $20,000, courtesy of absolute vodka
 and matte cosmetics.
 When I see BB, I don't see a man in a wig.
 I see a graceful, beautiful creature.
 She made it.
 There's more.
 Need a flower show.
 And snatching the trophy at this ball is--
 That's right, honey.
 If you're out proud and live in a gay life,
 you've got a drag queen to thank.
 BB, we have a harpo here, Nina didn't get it.
 Harpo, we've got a harpo there, a sad face there,
 and a sad face there.
 The correct answer is harpo.
 OK?
 Don't [BLEEP]
 And speaking of hearts, Jade melted mine from day one.
 All right, putting it into girls' control.
 You are not the Next Drag Superstar.
 Can you open?
 You have to create your own Oprah inspired look.
 The girls had to recreate Oprah's early career
 by reporting the news from a teleprompter.
 Repeat after me.
 Well, you know, us big girls have to work a little harder
 because they're so little.
 Which is the one to go away with.
 Well, life is not fair, BB.
 I have two words for you.
 What?
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
 Are you that kind of person?
 Are you a giving person?
 And then there were two.
 Wow, that's her mommy.
 I don't know.
 Maybe it's just me.
 I think she's wearing too much makeup.
 It feels like a mask.
 Michelle, how do you feel about your makeup?
 Each of you will be judged.
 Chanel.
 Beautiful.
 I will cause you.
 Another day, thanks.
 Prior to tonight, you were asked to prepare a lip sync
 performance, the drag queen classic, Whitney Houston's
 the greatest love of all.
 I was so impressed with the confidence
 that Rebecca showed in her interview with Tori and Dean.
 She doesn't--
 Nina?
 So full of potential.
 That's for sure.
 It really was as effective as your--
 Now this is RuPaul telling you at home.
 Don't [BLEEP] it up.
 Join me next week for the grand finale of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 And find out who will be crowned America's next drag superstar.
 And remember, if you can't love yourself,
 how the hell are you going to love somebody else?
 Can I get an amen up in here?
 How are you going to love somebody else?
 I think that I'm not used to.
 A lot of times, I'll ask myself, well, what
 was my contribution to making this situation the way it is?
 What do you think you've done to alienate the girls?
 What from the $0.99 store are you going to use on this outfit?
 I'm not sure yet.
 I would have to go and scrape through the stuff.
 You did something.
 I didn't think it was possible.
 We are looking for an international breakthrough star.
 And she just may be too regional, perhaps.
 Chanel and Sweet Peek.
 Chanela de Ville.
 Oh, that's my entrance.
 I said, time and live.
 I hear you.
 But honestly, I really do need you
 to give me one name for your life.
 Nerf and talent.
 How the hell are you going to love somebody else?
 Can I get an amen?
 Not two.
 If you think you know everything about our three finalists,
 think again.
 You brought to your performance tonight
 a fire and a hunger that I haven't seen before.
 Thank you very much and may join the other girls.
 Hey, racers.
 Mirror, mirror on the wall.
 Who's the greatest music video diva of them all?
 If you guess Madonna, you'll be paired coming up.
 There's one more twist to this challenge.
 She projected, say hello to a world-renowned celebrity
 photographer who's photographed Dolly Parton and Beyonce,
 and a very good friend, Mike Ruiz.
 You have exactly three hours to put your whole look together.
 I'll be back to check with you guys a little bit later.
 First up is--
 I just saw a messy man.
 Oof.
 We're not snorches.
 The next morning, the survivors had to ramp it up
 for the next challenge.
 Yeah.
 Need a flower?
 Akashka, you mother [BLEEP] broke the dawn.
 You-- you know what?
 You broke the dawn.
 You know, if I did have so much Botox, I'd be crying right now.
 This is your chance to reveal the secrets of drag.
 Wow.
 Oh, my gosh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't be worried.
 How are you going to hide your candy in a fabric so sheer,
 so revealing?
 And your screen test was very viva glam.
 Rossberry, Miss Diana Rossberry.
 The winner, good luck.
 Well, somebody slipped into something a little more
 comfortable.
 And that brings us to right here and right now.
 And the best of the best are top three finalists,
 BB, Rebecca, and Nina.
 Coming up, if you think you know our final three
 queens, think again.
 Yes, Taylor.
 Yes, you stay.
 And hello to my pal, the shamelessly outspoken designer
 who's no stranger to the runway, shake the dice,
 and steal the rice.
 I've made my decision.
 You are the winner of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 Tonight, for the first time on the main stage,
 the girls will be wearing their very own drag creations,
 so they've got no excuse.
 Yeah.
 You know, I thought you did a really great job.
 You put your arm up like this until now.
 Wow.
 Now, let's see Street Peace before photo.
 Wow.
 And look at her now.
 She's like a mother, daughter, S&M team.
 Yes.
 Jay.
 Hey.
 Hey, there you go.
 There you go.
 That is way too much.
 Akasha.
 You known for your beauty?
 Yes.
 That's right, honey.
 Hello, resistance.
 And welcome to the starting line of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 Ladies, you lunch.
 So dulling.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Have you thought about what you're going to do after the show?
 Let's go, let's go, let's go.
 Take a kick ass.
 The contestants had to transform the girl fighters into drag daughters.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 So put your stonato to the meadow.
 And let's take this mother from zero to fabulous in 3.5 seconds.
 Who do you think you are?
 Who do you think you are?
 Who do you think you are?
 And who do you think you are?
 On China.
 For this week's challenge.
 It's next up, we divided the remaining eight girls into two girl groups.
 After your screen test, you were asked to do a little modeling for us on the set.
 But you, you walked off the set.
 But to be the next drag superstar, you've got to do the job in front of you and not
 let your emotions get the better of you.
 Then the girls found out that our extra special guest judge was none other than Michelle
 Williams from Destiny's Child.
 Bam.
 Rebecca and Temple, come on down.
 Let's see her before photo.
 Now, I'd like to introduce you to an absolute genius from Absolute vodka, Mr. Jeffrey Moran.
 Mmm.
 This is what Josephine Baker would look like today.
 Oh.
 In the flowers.
 Hey dolls.
 Hey lady.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Wow, look at these.
 Look at y'all.
 It's almost too competitive because she's really, really angling in there and it shows
 around the edges.
 I think a good competitor kind of may sit back a little bit.
 All right.
 So Michelle, Akasha, what do you think?
 She's waiting for you outside.
 On China, your expertise with makeup and your flair for the dramatic work to your advantage.
 You've come from the very bottom back to the top.
 Come back, kid.
 I love it.
 Thank you, boy.
 First is Rebecca.
 Thank you, judges and ladies.
 While you all wait in the interior illusions lounge, the judges and I will deliberate.
 Ooh.
 So chic.
 Adorable.
 Couture.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 One's that Tammy is on a cautious team.
 I'm with the black girls.
 Rebecca.
 Evading was introduced to the world in the cult classic Paris' Burning and, of course,
 the mainstream learned about voguing from another queen named Madonna.
 Yes.
 Laughter through tears, my dears.
 This contest will make us stronger.
 Congratulations.
 Hi.
 Hello, Nina.
 Come around here, darling.
 Hi.
 Good to see you.
 Mmm.
 Good to see you.
 Oh, my God.
 Sit down.
 Oh.
 Oh.
 I just wanted to have a little lunch with you and eat some of my favorite things.
 I love it.
 I've already had too many.
 Maroon.
 Say it again with me.
 Beebee.
 Miss Mango.
 Think a little bit more about this.
 Now, I did notice back there that you were adjusting your junk a little bit.
 I just wanted to make sure that I was presentable.
 I was wowed by Chanel's vast knowledge and a wardrobe that almost rivaled my own.
 He is ripe.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 It's Beebee.
 But you really came out of your shell this week.
 Congratulations.
 You're still in the race.
 This outfit has to scream you.
 You have the rest of the day to work.
 And remember, you will be judged on both your drag on a dime outfit and your photo from
 today's shoot.
 When you present yourself tomorrow on the main stage, in addition to being beautiful,
 the judges will be looking for your charisma.
 Oh, just a little advice, um, sees every moment.
 You could have given us more to work with in the screen test.
 Thank you, Rebecca.
 This is the lot going on.
 It is the lot going on.
 Mm-hmm.
 Uh-huh.
 You keep getting back up on your feet.
 Based on how good your partner's makeup looks.
 Uh-huh.
 The truth is, you are beautiful.
 You are really beautiful.
 Thank you.
 I want it answered, honestly.
 If you said, I'm getting rid of all these bitches, I would accept that.
 And as beautiful as these dolls are, well, this is it.
 The final lap, the grand finale of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 As always, I'd like to say hello to my fabulous judges, fashion journalist, Rogenzberg, and
 to my pal, Santino.
 Tonight, we will crown America's Next Drag Superstar.
 And because nobody knows these girls better than we do, there will be no guest judges.
 What's that?
 I'll see you all next week.
 And remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody
 else?
 Can I get an amen in here?
 I, RuPaul, was born a poor black child.
 In the Brewster Housing Projects of San Diego, California, for you to lip sync for your life.
 Welcome, ladies.
 All right, let's move on.
 Rebecca, Ms. Citron, hey.
 So what do you have planned?
 How are you gonna blow me away creatively?
 Ah, that's a secret.
 Oh, ancient Chinese secret, huh?
 Yes.
 But no one was prepared for what happened when Anjina won the challenge.
 And talent, start your engines.
 May the best woman win.
 Oh, no.
 We were looking for mother daughter, and you gave us father daughter.
 It's almost as if you misunderstood this challenge.
 This means you were in the bottom, too.
 Before me are two beautiful queens.
 Okay.
 Nevertheless, I like.
 You know, she could very easily go and represent Viva Glam and answer questions that she's
 never happened.
 Anjina.
 Anjina.
 In the time has come.
 But you didn't need me to tell you that.
 But it sounds good.
 Oh, gosh.
 But it wasn't all gloom and doom.
 After the channel, you're in her Oprah challenge.
 The contestants were as giddy as schoolgirls.
 As with girl groups throughout the ages, there was plenty of diva, Rebecca won.
 So Anjina and Vibi had to lip-sync for their lives.
 And Vibi turned it out.
 Anjina.
 Anjina, though this breaks my heart to say.
 Thank you, Vibi.
 Chanel, who should be eliminated tonight?
 How are you?
 Mom.
 Mom.
 I went ahead and ordered without you.
 Tomorrow, the judges will see the results of your Oprah challenge.
 Okay, perfect.
 Vibi's Rob.
 Chanel.
 I see.
 I see.
 I see.
 When you were growing up, was there a woman who you?
 I'm rolling with a noob.
 Our next finalist is cut from a very different cloth.
 Rebecca Glasscock.
 I've made my decision.
 Coming up, one of you will win this challenge, and one of you will be sent home.
 Anjina.
 I saw you over there practicing.
 Two minutes and ten seconds.
 Oh my God.
 For you to lip-sync.
 So, welcome back girls.
 We've set up a TV studio where you'll retrace Oprah's career in three steps.
 First, from her early days as an anchor woman, you'll report the news using a television
 prompter.
 Second, you'll present a product just like on Oprah's favorite things.
 And third, you'll interview two fabulous surprise celebrity guests.
 Negative things about her?
 Good luck.
 I mean, it kind of hurt.
 Oh my God.
 Hey, Mommykins.
 How you doing?
 It's very quiet in here.
 Yeah.
 You two are going to vogue it out.
 You know, honestly, Rebecca, I hear what you're saying and I get the concept, but it seems
 like it's just taken from the hanger and put onto the dress form.
 I really want to see a little bit more creativity.
 Welcome back to an extra special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 I'm here with my judges, Merle Ginsburg and Santino.
 Hi, guys.
 Hi, Ru.
 I asked you guys to come up with the top 10 most unforgettable fashion moments on RuPaul's
 Drag Race.
 Was it easy?
 Maria.
 What do you think?
 Strutting their stuff on the runway, the judges and I will deliberate.
 But we didn't see your best look this week.
 BB, this is your moment.
 I pass the reins onto you, my dear.
 It will be your job to spread the love, the message, the beauty of being the next drag
 superstar.
 Hi, mama.
 How you doing?
 Good.
 Really good.
 What have you learned from BB so far on the show?
 And they're the best woman.
 And it was just a point you see you give up like that.
 How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
 Now, you have something you want to tell our ladies.
 Today, these ladies have given you one tough workout.
 I see Africa.
 The judges will be looking for your charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent.
 Say again with me.
 When the girls came in the next day, the tension was white hot.
 I want to see your Viva Glam.
 So your challenge this week is to star in your own screen test.
 10 minutes, start now.
 For you to lip sync for your life.
 Good luck, ladies.
 And don't f*** it up.
 Without my daughter, I may the best woman win.
 Coming up.
 Dolls, can I get your attention?
 I have a little bitty twist for you.
 Let's look at your screen test.
 I hope you don't mind.
 Not at all.
 A lot of people would say you're the youngest one here.
 A lot of the girls have more experience than you and that you're in over your head.
 What do you say to that?
 You had a little trouble with your gown earlier.
 Every diva knows to give the gown a test run.
 Let's take a look at your Oprah challenge.
 You have to celebrate life.
 You keep going.
 The show must go on and one queen had to go home.
 Jane.
 Okay, the takeaway I get from Tammy is how important her sense of history is.
 Don't be afraid to explore old movies or music videos, discover your fashion icons.
 I did.
 Wow.
 Both of you.
 Both of you.
 And you may leave the stage.
 Wow.
 Look at that beautiful face.
 Let's see her before photo.
 Rebecca Glasscock.
 I did see the Viva Glam there.
 Coming up.
 Never before seen footage.
 She looks a little draggy.
 Category evening gown.
 Extravaganza.
 And when you do, there'll be no stopping you.
 But for tonight, Nina Flowers, I have a tough question to ask you.
 Drag race just keeps on trucking.
 Thank you judges.
 Okay, great.
 Okay.
 Thank you, Angela.
 Chanel.
 What's that, baby?
 Are you ready for your Viva Glam screen test?
 You know?
 I really believe I am.
 Okay.
 And 10 minutes.
 It's too difficult.
 Nay.
 There's one more twist to this challenge.
 We're struck by Rebecca's undeniable beauty.
 Don't.
 Somehow I don't.
 Gorgeous.
 I don't think you can handle this.
 In the end, Akasha and Tammy had to lip sync for their lives.
 One will be in charge of hair, one will be in charge of makeup, and one will be in charge
 of costumes.
 All right, girls.
 You need to incorporate your real fruit into your evening gown presentation.
 No.
 Gentlemen.
 With baby.
 But baby.
 Gentlemen, let's look at your Viva Glam on China.
 She's a good witch.
 Look tomorrow when I leave.
 Hey.
 And charisma.
 My queen.
 To a rocky start.
 I mean, obviously, one's black and one's white, but this one has several and they're all
 mine.
 Oh, baby.
 Oh, yeah.
 To two queens.
 Pick your first group member, Santee.
 Oh.
 Easy.
 Easy.
 And on China.
 That's right, girl.
 Now, I was fortunate enough to be the first face of Mac Cosmetics Viva Glam.
 They all deserve our applause and support for making the world a better place.
 All right, pin's down.
 Let's take a look at your rap part in this class.
 Where is it?
 Look at that.
 There's no camel toe in this.
 Gentlemen.
 All right.
 Nina Flowers.
 Hello.
 This is your Mac Viva Glam screen test.
 You have 10 minutes for this challenge to show us your Viva Glam because, you know what,
 I'm telling you, you look fantastic.
 Thank you very much, Ruth.
 You can use the furniture or you don't have to use the furniture.
 Let's do the furniture.
 Okay.
 Wonderful.
 Thank you, Canyon.
 Well, all right, you too.
 Thank you very much.
 You can't see your face until the end of the mini challenge.
 That's why we've covered up these fabulous Mac mirrors.
 That middler luau here.
 The time has come.
 In your photo, you really gave it.
 But I don't need to tell you your drag outfit and your runway presentation were not hit with
 the judges.
 I have made my decision.
 You have to recreate your glamorous drag look using hand-me-downs from the studio wardrobe
 department on Highland.
 And to help you accessorize, we went to the dollar store and got you a whole bunch of
 crazy, you know.
 Hi, Ruth.
 Are you going to have time to put some time into your outfit?
 I already steamed the dress.
 And this is the dress you're talking about here.
 Exactly.
 And then there's Chanel.
 Let's go.
 House of Cameroon.
 Stress.
 Are you stressed?
 Miss Nina Flowers.
 Nina Flowers.
 Yes.
 Your looks screamed realness.
 This is exactly what we were looking for.
 You had immunity this week.
 It's like four years.
 Nurse.
 Yeah.
 Tomorrow on the main stage, we're going to throw a house ball like no other.
 This ball will be sponsored by Absolute Vodka.
 Yes, honey, Chanel.
 It is milk in time.
 It is.
 Oh my goodness.
 Good evening and welcome to the main stage of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 I'd like to say hi to my fabulous judges.
 First, fashion journalist and best-selling author, Merle Ginsburg.
 Hello.
 And hello to the shamelessly outspoken designer who is no stranger to the runway.
 Shake the dice.
 Still the right.
 Santino.
 Our guest judge this week is Absolute Vodka's image czar.
 Please welcome Jeffrey Moran and our extra special guest judge this week, actress, singer
 and former Ms. Venezuela, Maria Conchita Alonzo.
 And Kim.
 Now, the challenge this week was for the girls to throw a house ball representing a different
 real fruit flavor.
 Each girl was asked to bring their own outrageous style to three categories.
 Well, and then there's Anjina, a queen who's small in size, but not in soul and spirit.
 More in her ability to deep throat a hot dog.
 Merle.
 Santino.
 Are you ready?
