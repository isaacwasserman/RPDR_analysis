 I don't like to talk about people behind their back.
 That's not my style.
 But I've always thought that big jewels and lavish costumes
 are just there for lack of talent.
 I did not do my best, but I'm not going to give up
 till I cross that finish line.
 Regardless of what happens, there is no way
 that I'm going to stop.
 Oh, that's the--
 Let me tell you some girl from the voice of experience.
 You want to fix that walk if you want to look fierce.
 I know a simple and effective way to better it all.
 You got to put some base if you want to do the walk.
 See this?
 Yes, I'm trying to tell the rule.
 What is that?
 I'm in there.
 Watch.
 Pull it?
 It's gone.
 What happened?
 Oh, yeah.
 I don't tape.
 I won't be able to make it, so make sure you click on it.
 Vote, vote, vote every 24 hours.
 Hit it, girl.
 Well, I wanted the neck to stand up.
 So inside, there is a fly-swat sweater.
 Mm-hmm.
 Inside, I'm so behind.
 And when I thought that maybe I had
 something, that's when RuPaul came around.
 And I was like, oh.
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
 I think maybe keeping to myself might have been
 misread as, oh, you know, she's standing offish,
 or, you know, she's trying to throw shade.
 But it's just base honey.
 Glasscock for your nurse, mama.
 100% of the sale price of these MAC lipsticks
 goes to help raise awareness.
 I'm Rebecca Glasscock.
 Right now that here.
 But the nightlands hold it.
 Someone is always going to say, oh, I hate her.
 She's so pretty.
 Or she does this better than me.
 It's not something that I'm not used to.
 My sister, you know, and--
 This has to be like the hardest challenge.
 Thank you, guys.
 I was supposed to do lemons in color right now, huh?
 I ended up falling in love with the color.
 And everything worked out for my advantage,
 because all the other girls were having problems
 incorporating the fruit into their outfits.
 So I'm feeling lucky.
 And let's see what the judges say.
 Mudda just throwing the news over my neck.
 Keep the shade aside.
 I'm going to grab my-- I'm going to grab my heels.
 Stay right here.
 She was creepy.
 They don't know you as I, you know?
 Pretty exasperated with the whole process.
 Usually, I have a little bit of more time
 to do my makeup and hair.
 But I'm just so unhappy with everything.
 Do it.
 I'm not sure she's going to learn her walk.
 So I can't cut her any slack right now.
 Do it by yourself right now.
 Hit another five lovely hours in heels.
 It's been an incredible journey.
 But it's been really long.
 How can I present myself confidently in front of a camera
 when, you know, I feel like something's wrong?
 Yeah, I love it.
 I think Bebe's going to do extremely poorly on the challenge.
 It's either she pulls something out of the hat,
 or she's going to be set home.
 I'm not a good dancer, but I'm a good dance faker.
 This might be a recipe for a disaster.
 Making anything from garbage to couture.
 She would be my biggest competition.
 And I love it.
 Here I am talking about what MAC AIDS Fund does.
 And I started thinking of my best friend, who--
 on "China."
 World leaders from Japanese Prime Minister Yasu Hakuda
 to German Chancellor Angela Merkel were appalled.
 I honestly think that most of the girls were rooting for Jade.
 I'm sorry, but hey, I don't want to go.
 I really came here to win.
 Yeah.
 It's going to be like this.
 I'm going to give you my breast with the--
 Yes.
 Lemon chiffon.
 Can you--
 The goodies weren't exposed, so--
 And action.
 Ooh.
 And I still have that picture because the reminder of where
 I came from and how far I've come.
 All my family knows that I do drag.
 There was a point in time that they did not approve,
 but now my mom has turned into my biggest cheerleader
 and my straight older brother shoots
 all my performances on video and makes me happy.
 I think they're happy with that.
 All the judges mean, I love to tell you some growth
 when the boys are experienced.
 You want to fix that walk if you want to look fierce.
 I know it's simple and effective way to better at all.
 You've got to put some base if you want to do the walk.
 I would have never expected anything like this.
 I think in order to win this competition,
 I have to stay focused on the prize.
 I can't let things like friendships get in the way
 I came here to win.
 All right, bitch.
 Why?
 You know what?
 Three competitors are nice girls, and I love them all.
 But some of them have already peaked at whatever
 they were going to do drag-wise.
 And I, you know, should have the opportunity to progress
 and grow.
 Time to eat so something.
 I think Oprah has many faces.
 She is a woman in charge, so I think my outfit
 is going to reflect that.
 And we're making history, and we're the first cast
 of the RuPaul's drag race.
 So we are already all winners.
 None of us need to leave.
 I wanted to keep my pitch very light,
 and I definitely wanted to have some kind of a pace.
 You ready? Start the clock?
 Team B.
 I think my worst enemy.
 No.
 Oh, girl.
 Morning.
 One more week to go.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 Now let me tell you something, girl.
 From the voice of experience.
 You want to fix your walk if you want to live fierce.
 I know it's simple and effective way to better at all.
 You've got to put some base if you want to do the walk.
 I can't go home now.
 I mean, this is not happening.
 I'm Javier.
 I'm 26 years old.
 Yes.
 It's my thing.
 It's crazy.
 Isn't it?
 I'm just a small-town girl from sunny Florida
 with a big dream of becoming the next drag superstar.
 I let my emotions control.
 What?
 It's a pen.
 Girl, just use one of your eyeliner pencils or something.
 It's just a sketch.
 Can I go?
 I'm going to take a sip.
 I should use it.
 I--
 I--
 Jump, jump.
 All right, here, try these on.
 Right now, we're going to have to turn the girls
 from tough boxing ass-kicking chicks
 to models on the runway with grace and beauty.
 I'm not a bitch.
 I'm just trying to get them all riled up.
 Maybe you know what we can do.
 Quicker and, like, quicker.
 I decided to be very ambitious and do speed-wrapping.
 What the hell was I thinking?
 Like, literally, I--
 I think maybe it's just because they're a little bit older.
 It's a lot that you didn't try, and that's why, you know,
 I'm not one that likes to interrupt a judge when he's
 given a critique, but I did have to tell them that you did.
 They spent hours.
 You have to get bird farms.
 I love it.
 I think you're hilarious.
 He's-- there's just not enough time.
 I'm just going to screw everything up.
 And you're going to be in heels tomorrow, though.
 A hot--
 I felt comfortable with what I was wearing,
 and I felt good with the makeup that I was wearing.
 D-Trite Rock City.
 Another thing.
 What are you going to do?
 I do one thing that they tell me one week,
 and I come back the next week, and I do what they tell me to do,
 and I still get shut down for it.
 I'm already there, but it's going to be better.
 Nothing but a hustle from "Remember"
 without your support in your clothes.
 That's the way I am.
 Some of the girls think that Akasha
 may be a little mean-spirited.
 Maybe if she was nicer and the girls liked her,
 they wouldn't be rooting for her to go home.
 It was hard at night.
 OK, yeah.
 Tint on a slide.
 Make up in the hair or that.
 I'm not ready.
 I'm not happy with my makeup or my look or my hair.
 And just everything's a mess.
 I actually started performing as Jade in January 8th of 2003.
 This is my mom without her.
 Do you know what you think?
 I don't know.
 She now is here to kill.
 This is not just makeup or lipstick.
 This is makeup with a purpose.
 And that's when it really hit me.
 It wasn't a challenge.
 Coming up, plug it in and blow.
 I can do that again.
 Nope.
 I want to say that I'm surprised that I won, but I'm not.
 I don't think any other contestant did, as well as we did.
 I knew it was going to be at least safe where--
 They will have to do--
 I don't care if I'm ready to have a heart attack.
 I'm going to keep on punching those eggs because I want to win.
 OK.
 What some of the other girls are trying
 to go for the look-alike Oprah?
 Oh, [BLEEP]
 None of the girls like me.
 Aviva Glam.
 I know we must look so cute right about now.
 We're going down the runway.
 And I think we're hitting the same steps.
 We're on the same pace.
 And we're definitely giving mother-daughter vibes.
 This is really hard.
 I'm a little worried.
 Her feet hurt.
 She was crying.
 She was whiny.
 Yeah.
 No good clothes.
 Unless you're quick.
 Should we go like this and then open?
 Or should we just--
 I don't want to have to worry about you,
 so I want you to be ready.
 Listen to Fair with Iranian President Mayi Lipstick.
 I'm going to have to pull something out of the hat
 and literally--
 And what's yours mean?
 I don't want to tell him anything.
 I want everything to be a surprise for when I walk out
 in the runway.
 He's truly surprised.
 It's not something that he saw in the works.
 Being on the final four is a dream come true,
 because I only have three more people to be.
 So more people eliminate the closer
 I get to the finish line.
 I haven't thought it out that far.
 Good taking us.
 I was-- when I saw my face for the first time,
 it was a shocker, because--
 OK, man, this is going to be--
 And I'm going to help save lives.
 I don't know if any of the other girls are angry that I'm still
 here.
 My eyes were wandering across the room,
 and I was checking everyone out,
 kind of sizing up the competition.
 But every time I look at Tammy, she was staring at me,
 and she was winking.
 Yes, we'll have that crazy about it.
 The challenges to channel are in her Oprah.
 And to me, Oprah is a very ready-for-anything kind of girl.
 You know, I hit close to home for me,
 and, you know, I let my emotions take over.
 However, I had to keep myself together,
 because I am now going home just because I'm
 in an ugly garment.
 Ladies, hi, I'm Rebecca Glasscock,
 and I'm your absolute patron girl.
 Thank you for having me.
 And why?
 I think that Chanel might be my biggest competition.
 However, with that outfit, I ended up finishing my outfit.
 And so I only have to do my hair and my makeup.
 I'm going to try to make some magic happen.
 And go.
 These are hot.
 You heard that part there?
 It was like, look at you.
 Shut the [BLEEP] up.
 Honestly, think about it.
 I really dreamed, too.
 We shouldn't be going through this [BLEEP]
 Yeah.
 We should be finishing the outfit,
 and making a fierce choreography, and, you know, kicking out.
 I have two.
 I want her to look more youthful, and me a little bit more
 like a mom.
 Sexy.
 Sexy, but mom.
 A sexy mom.
 A milk.
 Yes.
 Exactly.
 I was trying to give the judges something different.
 One of their comments says, oh, you look pretty,
 but we want to see more.
 So I was bored, and I decided to--
 Last girl standing is the one that's
 going to win this challenge.
 I've made it this far.
 I've come all the way from Florida to California,
 and they're looking for the next drag superstar.
 So why would I go home?
 So I'm just waiting for Rebecca.
 Where's Rebecca?
 It was personal.
 We are the chosen nine.
 I decided to trash first off completely,
 and start from scratch.
 Hopefully, RuPaul likes it.
 This is all barbecue tin foil.
 Yeah.
 At this point, I'm just worried about finishing my own stuff.
 So the last thing on my mind is three other girls.
 I was grossed out, and disgusted.
 Pulled up and done.
 I'm giving her tough love.
 I lost control.
 At that point, I felt like a complete failure.
 There is no connection between me
 and the girls, and no one has seen my personality
 because the other girls won't shut up.
 And the people think that because you're
 shy, that you are a bitch or something.
 Look, I need to be alone right now.
 I'm not used to seeing myself like that, period.
 It's not something that I would try.
 The first time that I ever saw a drag queen,
 but I feel pretty confident.
 I'm very competitive.
 I just got to keep my eye on the prize and play this as a game.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Just think.
 Well, I already know what I'm going to do for Nina.
 I'm going to give her her sleeves.
 OK.
 And everything's going to be tight to the body.
 It was kind of nice to see all the girls out of drag
 because you never really meet someone
 until you meet them out of drag.
 And you really meet the person behind the mask.
 OK.
 They came down to whatever.
 I can't do anything else.
 I'm just going to have to do it with crappy makeup
 and just crazy ass hair.
 So come on in, mommy.
 Take a rest, hopefully.
 Because we've got to look together.
 You get what I'm saying?
 It's been a wild, crazy ride.
 And just the experience of a lifetime,
 it was so consistent from head to toe.
 Back in the day, oh, crap.
 What is it?
 Get out for closet.
 A couple of yards, a very pretty fabric.
 I could make something out of it.
 But literally, we had crap.
 Well, you know, if they hurt, then walk faster.
 Within the drag world, we don't really
 call each other by our guy names.
 Whether we're in or out of drag, she's always going to be Nina.
 Beebe's going to be Beebe.
 I'm going to be Rebecca.
 Now I hear that Rebecca is Javier.
 Yeah.
 What can I do?
 I can help save someone's life doing something that
 comes so natural to me.
 There are--
 We're going to be in RuPaul's new music video.
 So we're going to be all over on MTV, and it's going to be awesome.
 Today is just a funky day for me.
 Thank you.
 Whoa.
 You know, I want to know why I was safe so that I can improve that.
 Oh, my God.
 She's a little annoying, you know, at times.
 OK.
 Girls, let's not forget.
 Well, I ended up starting a little bit late.
 There was just, like, a funky day.
 Nina did the best, but she's much older than me,
 and she was probably at the club when they started doing bogey.
 There's just not enough time, but I'm just
 going to put it on paper and take it into the mic
 and just make it happen.
 I'm going to bang this out now.
 I'm going to bang it out.
 I'm going to bang it out.
 I'm going to make it straight.
 But I will have to say Chanel.
 My direct persona allows me to do things
 that I wouldn't normally do as this extra special episode of RuPaul's
 "I want a life with purpose."
 Beauty doesn't only come from the exterior,
 but also from inside you.
 Looking to our hearts, looking to our soul.
 Yeah.
 Do it just back and forth.
 I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up in the bottom two
 just because I let my emotions get the best of me,
 and so that's going to cost me.
 Yeah, for a second.
 This is my best friend, you know.
 Can I do that again?
 Tell us a little bit about you.
 I get to go to me, as well, to do my rap.
 I think Tammy wanted to be in this competition very badly.
 He's going to die.
 It's total tell.
 It's just me and Jade, and I'm sorry, but hey, I don't want to go.
 And that's what they're judging me on.
 That's it.
 I don't know you as a person.
 Congratulations, bitch.
 My self-esteem has been going down.
 I needed something to give me that jolt
 so I can go back and get in the race.
 Here, this is a look that reflects on my attitude
 and the way that I am.
 So I like to call this a little bit of glamour with punk.
 Girl, relax, just can you?
 I'm just ready to give up.
 I'm out of breath.
 You can tell that my punches are weak.
 I don't think they understand what
 the challenge is about.
 The challenge is to channel Oprah, not look like her.
 Yes.
 OK, 10 minutes on the clock.
 Who should be eliminated tonight?
 Do we just get to pick one?
 Gorgeous.
 I love Taro because she's funny.
 She's a really tiny in person, and she's got really big boobs.
 Abigaya, I'm impersonating Bebe.
 Here we go.
 [LAUGHING]
 Get all out of the thump.
 Out of the three, I would say Chanel.
 Out of nowhere, right down, four more bars.
 Oh, dawg.
 And full for Jade, OK?
 Love you much.
 See you soon.
 However, competing and going through the stress
 and the crunch time, you really have to be millions
 of people dying each day due to HIV and AIDS.
 Go with the flow.
 Can you put a price on life?
 All right, we got what we got.
 OK, thinking is, I will see people have this preconceived
 notion that if you do drag, you're loud, or you're out there,
 me, myself as Javier, I'm actually very shy and not
 in your face.
 My drag persona allows me to maybe do things
 that I wouldn't normally do.
 Surprisingly, uh-huh.
 Do we just get to pick one?
 Do it by yourself right now.
 Where's the penis at?
 Compared to these other girls, Rebecca is still
 a baby in drag experience.
 And I've improved so quickly, maybe even quicker,
 than most drag queens would have.
 Teen model.
 Yes.
 Tell him that.
 Thank you so much.
 Yeah, you're welcome.
 Part of the whole challenge, while we're
 learning choreography, and we're wrapping and recording,
 and doing this and that, Ru wants to sit down with each of us
 and have lunch as well.
 We'll see you in good weeks.
 And comes a picker with fabrics, and hair, and accessories,
 and everything.
 It's so nice, because it has a cold shot.
 Can you put a price on life?
 OK.
 Some of the other girls grabbed clothes off the bins,
 and some of the girls just ended up
 using their own clothes.
 However, an idea hit me.
 I grabbed one of the bolts, and I started making something
 from scratch.
 I'm giving her a tough look.
 Want this.
 I really do.
 This is my dream.
 I have the drive, end of determination,
 and I'm going to keep going, and keep going,
 until I fulfill my dream.
 Thank you, Rebecca.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Pleasure is meeting you now.
 I might have encountered a little bit of shade
 from the other girls in this competition.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah, absolutely.
 However, that's on some--
 On China.
 Oh, I'm thinking as she can't [BLEEP] this up.
 I love you, too.
 And you know why I liked the way you looked last week?
 Darling, how are you doing?
 So I'm not having a good hair day.
 And I just say, you know what?
 Whatever.
 Can we take off this face?
 I thought you said you like it.
 No, I like it, but I don't want to do a photo shoot.
 That might be misconstrued as, oh, she's a bitch,
 but I mean, honestly.
 After all the drama and freaking out and everything,
 I love my outfit.
 It just cries me from top to bottom.
 I should be able to--
 But I did terrible.
 Waiting in the work room, the more time I had on my hands,
 the more--
 I hope so.
 I'm almost done.
 I can do that again.
 Yup, that's it.
 I am Viva Glam because--
 No, no, no, no, no.
 No one didn't have enough time to really fix my hair
 because they were like, hurry up, rip.
 I'm like, no!
 My back is drag light.
 I think my laidback attitude has
 been to my advantage in this competition
 because when you're trying to control everything
 and can't control anything, that's when you [BLEEP]
 everything up.
 Is there anything else you might want to say?
 For all those queens, we throw in shade.
 Suck on that, bitches.
 The first time that I ever saw a drag queen,
 I was grossed out and disgusted and wanted nothing
 to do with drag queens at all.
 But I think that was just like an initial reaction.
 The very first time that I dressed up in drag,
 it looked so awful.
 OK, hang on, hang on, hang on.
 OK, you've got to walk as fast as I do.
 Come on.
 Out of life.
 It has, you know, AIDS, HIV.
 If anything comes out of the show,
 it would be for other people to see maybe something that
 inspires them or shed some light on what it really is
 to be a female impersonator and to drag.
 I don't?
 I want to make a difference.
 I'm freaking out.
 I'm trying to cover the bird so I don't get read again today.
 In walks Michelle Williams from Destiny's Child.
 In my jaw, dropped.
 Tells a little bit about you.
 During the interview, I think some of the other girls
 might get a little nervous when they know
 who the celebrity is.
 You can't go.
 That doesn't come back to my opinion.
 Yeah, I'm not working.
 I don't even know where to start.
 I think B.V. is going to be set home.
 This is going to be very OK.
 Time I had to--
 Marita, excuse me.
 I don't think you want to do it with that nose either.
 Sorry.
 Oh my god, did I just--
 [LAUGHS]
 I made--
 You should do that online.
 My biggest fear is that my fighting bulldog,
 she won't be able to pull through and she'll suck.
