 - Now, what is yours?
 - No, sister.
 - Yeah.
 - Girl who start out, they all sound so wonderful like that,
 but I wanna know which one.
 - I want to see more Rebecca.
 I feel like I'm not seeing the Rebecca I think I see.
 I feel like that's a part of Rebecca that I don't know.
 Either she has a wall,
 which is not letting us know who she really is
 or she is just playing the game.
 I don't know if it's because you're trying to protect yourself,
 but I would just like to see you with more personality.
 - People just die in front of you, you know.
 - And delicious.
 - The first challenge came,
 it actually hit you in the face.
 Like guess what, this is competition.
 People switch from being nice to old.
 I don't care about what you're doing right now.
 I am going because I need to take care of myself.
 So it was like a reality check to your face.
 - Right?
 - It is.
 - It is.
 You have to take your mind away from being the butch woman.
 Let's just say you want to mesmerize people.
 - Yes.
 - 16 pairs of you.
 - I have had dresses.
 - I'm.
 - Same entertainment news, pop star Britney Spears
 who's got in an illicit affair.
 You read that teleprompter.
 - Because they wanted me a little bit.
 - Good morning, children.
 - It's really lovely.
 - Wow.
 - I don't know.
 - Bibi bele.
 - I was like, wow, I cannot believe this.
 You just have to leave every day and just hope for the better
 that someday you can contribute in your own way
 to make things better for people.
 - Yeah.
 So I mean, that's frustrating.
 When you have this perfect vision
 and you don't have what you need for that vision.
 - I guess you're thinking, okay, what's happening here?
 - What I was going to put her in
 and what I was going to put myself in.
 - In a fashion show, I was supposed to model as a man.
 Some of the female models did not show up
 and there was that shortage.
 That's when I got into like full drag, like being a female.
 And it was just something where I think my performance
 was really good.
 It created Bibi right there.
 - Oh, hey.
 - I wanted something a little bit glamour,
 but a little bit aged here.
 And quite different from the whole African look.
 - How bizarre was that?
 When she said you're safe, but you have to take it up a notch.
 I'm like, how do you take it up a notch
 when this is where you are?
 - Hello, my name is Bibi Zaha'hara Bani.
 And I know my makeup is really, really not in together
 just because what this is called is called cooking.
 So when you do your highlights and you do your cheekbones
 and your t-zones that you let this cook insect.
 And then when you're ready to heat the stage,
 you blend it also.
 It looks like a chest.
 - She's funny and she's very goofy.
 - Which was very frustrating to me.
 To me, this was like one of the greatest opportunities
 to be able to be with the legend
 and be able to see them from a different point of view.
 - It's not.
 - I don't even know where to start.
 - I'll be sitting over there.
 And the way you're done, just coming me over there.
 - So it was more about culture.
 It was more about the body language and the eyes.
 - It is so frustrating.
 - I am supposed to be Miss Rice Berry, absolute Rice Berry
 and I'm supposed to represent.
 - I walked into the room.
 My first impression was I thought all the girls
 were really stunning.
 But I bring a lot of international influence
 and I feel like right now I'm really ahead of the game.
 - It's.
 - The way I was dressed is how the women
 from where I come from would dress to celebrate.
 - I got what are they about to put us through?
 - The case.
 - It's not easy.
 - I'm sorry.
 - Seriously?
 - Yeah.
 - Just to really make it more painful,
 I have to use natural fruits on my dress.
 - And I have Rice Berry and it's really a messy kind of fruit.
 It's small but it's very messy.
 - I don't know what I'm gonna do with the fruit.
 - Girl, unless you have a fruit you can manage.
 - Oh, that's right.
 - You know, can I have those?
 - Michelle.
 - I decided to step away from looking like Oprah
 and I want to represent a business woman.
 - Media, logo, realness.
 - I really want to just represent that
 and show that you know what,
 you have to work hard to get here.
 What are you gonna wear?
 - Well, I'm going to be very simple and very classy
 and I'm going to be very concerned about it.
 - Somehow I don't believe you're going to be simple.
 - I'm gonna be here.
 - There's some things you just don't talk in public.
 You really have to watch reality.
 - When we started constructing our garments
 and I looked at Rebecca,
 she kept going back and forth like she didn't know
 what she wanted to wear, what kind of idea
 she was trying to create and stuff.
 So I think it was a little bit challenging to her.
 - Okay, there you go.
 - Hello there.
 My name is Vibi Zahara-Bene.
 I come from a faraway place,
 a place where HIV/AIDS is very rampant.
 Let us lend a helping hand.
 Mark Vibaglam is doing it.
 I am doing it.
 Can you do this?
 - No, I don't think this is the right word, confused it.
 I'm just going crazy.
 I'm like, wow.
 - But do you know how difficult it is
 to be six foot two and you have to work with two yards
 of fabric?
 - Oh, yeah.
 - How are you?
 - Good.
 - I was excited.
 I didn't know if I was meant to do a good job at it,
 but I was excited that I even got a chance to do it.
 - So I don't get read out again today.
 - You know what?
 I like that.
 I mean, the dance routine was fierce, fierce, fierce, fierce.
 - It's like, wow, they are really trying to--
 - Excuse me, ladies.
 - I won't say 100% that's what's happening,
 but I never go wrong with my instincts.
 - Nice to meet you.
 Africa is not only about the leopards, and the lions,
 and the tigers, and all that stuff.
 You know, it's also about dignity.
 - Oh, no, she did it, no.
 - I am doing it.
 - My inspiration was very dynamo-ra-free.
 I just made it very simple, very clean lines,
 different points of interest,
 and just let the whole body and the selling of it
 talk for itself.
 - I'd be thinking of sexy,
 think of somebody out there that you wanted to see you
 and you just want to be so sexy
 so that it can really know that you're the hardest things
 I'm of all the hardest things in the house.
 - The run we walk for me would not be about catwalk.
 It would be about seducing.
 - When you're trying to walk with your friends
 and you're looking cute, how do you walk?
 - And we move, RuPaul's Drag Race.
 - I should win this because I will let people out there know
 that it's pride and there's dignity in what we do.
 Dressing up for a living does not make us less of a man.
 - Thank you, baby.
 - When I looked at the teleprompter
 and I was supposed to read the news,
 all of a sudden you get all these words.
 - Two judges are telling you one thing.
 I know that two judges telling you,
 and we call Phoebe.
 - My name is Naomi Shukudina.
 I'm from Cameroon.
 I was not the typical sister.
 Take this energy and turn it in and make it positive.
 - Can I walk on you while you're doing it?
 - They're judging us on how we make our other people,
 you know, our babies look.
 So, oh, it's my executive look.
 And I think it just works perfect.
 - I was representing the Zahara Enterprise.
 It's an act.
 I don't want to say Rebecca, you are a bitch.
 No, I do not want to say that.
 But guess what?
 Rebecca made win this because she's probably once
 the judges want.
 When you think of how much praise she has
 throughout all of the challenges.
 Oh my God, you're beautiful.
 Yes, you can work on this,
 but you're lovely, you're a dad.
 You're beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty,
 beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty.
 - Give me Zahara.
 It's very, very versatile.
 - And I see a lot of that in Oprah, obviously,
 because she's an entrepreneur.
 - You!
 - Yeah, it happens in the club, especially.
 - Oh, yeah.
 - And right now it's really overwhelming to me
 because how am I going to do all of this,
 be able to make sure that all the work is done?
 And so I'm just thinking, okay, what do I start with?
 Where do I put that?
 What would I have to work with?
 - Oh my God, we have to get all of this together.
 And so I'm just going crazy.
 - This is your up.
 - I have just developed a character.
 And that's where people need to find that fine line
 so that when they look at us perform,
 they don't necessarily think that,
 oh, they are dressed up like this
 because they want to live like this.
 No, that is just such a misconception.
 - Oh, I don't go home like this.
 I don't live my life like this.
 - Unless you're cleaning the house.
 - Okay, I'm less than cleaning the house.
 - And like, obviously, I was coming to compete to win,
 but then you come and then you find people
 that you get along with so well, you know,
 and you just build that friendship.
 - I hope that we really keep in touch
 and previously on RuPaul's Drag Race,
 today in entertainment news,
 pop star Britney Spears has caught in it.
 - I believe so much in community outreach.
 Cameroon has its own problems.
 You know, when it comes to HIV/AIDS,
 when it comes to poverty,
 there are no like medications and stuffs and...
 - I know, you know, it's definitely going to weigh
 something very over the top, very cost.
 Because I will look tomorrow when I do.
 - Okay, let me see, let me see you be yourself.
 Cheryl was talking about being a bitch,
 which means that you need to have confidence,
 you have to have attitude,
 and you have to be very sassy.
 But not necessarily me.
 - So did everybody sleep well?
 - She built.
 - Fight!
 Because I come from Cameroon,
 which is in West Africa.
 - I don't think we all have kids
 that's what we're talking about.
 - And we switch it around?
 - We don't have enough yards.
 - That's not my territory.
 - You will do what I want you to do.
 I knew right away.
 - And your Christian underwear.
 It makes me definitely comfortable.
 - So he doesn't make it up.
 - I don't do that.
 We had just hours to go out and present
 this wonderful package,
 and things were really not going as sweet
 as I thought they should.
 - Yeah, please.
 It really needs to go away.
 - This morning, we get up,
 and we're coming into the workroom,
 and I am feeling a little frustrated.
 - I need some liquor.
 - This thing, I think.
 - What do you need?
 - I can't show you how to start working,
 and we don't have that much time, honey.
 - I was trying to exert some leadership
 just because I can't show up.
 - Was a little lacking.
 - So why is it hard for you?
 - Where I come from in Cameroon,
 HIV/AIDS, it's such a big issue,
 and I have been a witness to it,
 and I'm a very spiritual person.
 And to me, this was just a way
 to really, really create an awareness.
 - Hey, how are you?
 - Oh, I like it.
 I like it slightly.
 - Okay, watch out for me when I hit that phrase.
 Free body.
 - Yes.
 - Yeah.
 - My name is Nea Amashu Karina.
 I'm from West Africa.
 Precisely Cameroon.
 - Can you do it?
 - The fact is that I do not live my life as a woman.
 It's not my lifestyle.
 I'm also known as Phoebe Sahara Benet.
 - Thank you.
 - What's up?
 - Who said?
 - Hello there.
 I am this absolute respiratory.
 - I said from his energy,
 because when I talk to him,
 he gave me that assurance
 that you know what you can do this.
 - How is yours underneath?
 Is it sewn?
 - Or is it?
 - You have to hot glue.
 - Mine is done, mine is done.
 - There was just a lot of last many things
 that had to be done.
 I had to spend a lot of time
 piecing my own costume
 to get a last minute.
 Do you know how you create the whole top and stuff?
 - I'm larger than life.
 That's what I'm doing.
 You know what I mean?
 That's my own way of presenting myself.
 That is my drag, you know.
 I'm not trying to fool anybody from a man or woman.
 Now if you think, I am, okay, thank you.
 - Hey, how do I make up?
 - Oh, girl.
 - I was hoping for more compliments.
 I was hoping for more good choice of wardrobe.
 That wasn't, he just caught me off guard.
 - That's how I feel.
 - So, I wasn't doing runway fashion per se.
 I was doing my own way of looking at this challenge.
 - Masculine, Cameroonian man.
 When I was growing up,
 I used to wear my mom's heels.
 I would go into like her amoia
 and try on different things,
 just because I was very intrigued.
 - Oh, perfect camera.
 - You know, I thought I was going to be very nervous
 seeing all the green screen and everything,
 but it was a wonderful experience.
 - I was supposed to model as a man.
 Some of the female models did not show up.
 - My mom, she helped.
 - All right, it's the best challenge,
 but we don't know what will happen.
 And Akasha, you worked it out.
 I'm sorry, you really, really did.
 - I was frustrated because this challenge is quite a lot.
 We have three different challenges in one.
 We have to present an executive realness.
 We have to do an evening gown,
 and then we have to do swimsuit.
 - Miss Vivi, how do you feel about this?
 - Girl, I'm going through it right now.
 I look at the set and I look at ruined all the charges,
 and I was like, oh my God, try these on.
 It feels really good that I want today,
 but you know, the show is not over yet.
 The journey has just begun.
 Look at that train.
 - Mom, she did not.
 It's hard, it's very hard.
 - I don't think because you have not been bottomed
 to it means you're that fierce.
 - When I first walked into the competition,
 I told myself that I was going to stay true to myself,
 and that has taken me all the way up to the final three.
 - The latter, the last day.
 - Hello, doll.
 - How are you, Miss Glasgow?
 - Hi.
 - We're not here, we're still here.
 - We're still here, but I really want to say congratulations
 to you, Akasha.
 - Welcome to the show.
 - I'm the shimmy.
 - The shimmy shimmy's and the rap and the sip.
 Right now, I'm overwhelmed because I can't believe
 that it finally happened.
 Like, a dream that you've been dreaming all the time
 coming to life.
 - Torey, you guys had a hit TV show.
 Torey and Dean, tell us a little bit more about that.
 - People can look at what's together.
 - Okay, you have seven minutes in.
 - I've never booked before.
 I mean, where I come from, I mean, obviously,
 you don't hear of anything like a ball.
 - So, it was a little challenging for me.
 - You're kind of crying out for help.
 - Charo has such a big spirit.
 I mean, it's like everybody's so tense.
 And so she comes and it's like uplifting your spirit,
 making you forget about how much work you have to do
 and just taking that little break to just laugh.
 - You know, I'll be more.
 - All the time.
 - Really?
 - How do you do it?
 - I'll fix yours.
 What's going through my mind when Rebecca is painting me
 was how does she make me look?
 - It's kind of scary.
 - She's made people view us in a different light
 and has really opened doors for a lot of drive artists,
 like me.
 - Yes.
 - Excellent.
 - We're all done.
 - Not sure.
 - Today in entertainment news,
 pop star Britney Spears was caught in an illicit affair
 with Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahamanajak.
 - And I tell him the truth.
 - I tell him that it's an illusion.
 - I can represent Africa.
 - And you should represent the Middle East with the...
 - My name is Neha Masha Kourina.
 - I'm good.
 - My parents actually, they were very encouraging
 and their only concern was if this is something you want to do,
 be very successful at it.
 I don't think there's more you can ask.
 - Nahomo, I had no clue that it was going to be
 Tory and Dean.
 - Tory is so good, man.
 - And then Dean is so handsome.
 - Same question, I would say Rebecca,
 because working with her is frustrating and rude
 when it comes down to eat.
 Amongst all of us, I know Rebecca is at a lower level.
 - You have to fold it into like this, right?
 - Exactly.
 - Mine is just too bubblegum, too candy.
 I mean, I love red, but the colors are just not working.
 I mean, do you think this color goes with this?
 - No, no, no, no.
 - She is either putting a front,
 just so that she doesn't really show
 the real Rebecca out there, or we were all rushed
 for this music video.
 I was rushed.
 I wasn't really together the way I wanted to be,
 but you know what, I made sure all the little details
 that I know.
 - Beautiful, that was great.
 - Rebecca acting vulnerable in front of the judges
 as if she is still finding Rebecca.
 It's a little bit frustrating to me.
 - That would be a beautiful day when it was really big.
 This is Bibi Zaharbe.
 Girl, you need to keep going over there, son, baby.
 Over 11.
 - I'm not.
 - I am here to be the next drag queen superstar.
 I really am.
 - The colors are just until now.
 - I always tell people that drag artists
 are more men than we have met.
 Look at what a drag artist has to go through
 in being what they are.
 You need to have a lot of courage,
 a lot of personality, a lot of guts
 to be able to go out there,
 because you're going to get criticism from...
 - Hey.
 - Hey.
 - Bye.
 - Bye.
 - Bibi, nice to meet you.
 - That's what I have to say.
 - Even if it's not for the competition for yourself,
 take the energy, take the bad energy and make it possible.
 The game is so on.
 It's going to be about it right now.
 And I'm thinking, I come from a family
 with a lot of dignity, and we've always learned
 how to grow and be able to be strong.
 In fact, if I get eliminated today,
 it shouldn't be because I do not put my best out there.
 Rehearsal.
 Hello, there.
 My name is Bibi Zahara-Bene,
 and I stand in front of you as a spokesmodel
 for Mack Viva-Glam.
 Mack Viva-Glam gives 100% of these proceeds
 to benefit HIV/AIDS.
 I come from a faraway place,
 a place where HIV/AIDS is very rampant.
 That place, my home, is called Africa.
 Let us lend a helping hand.
 Mack Viva-Glam is doing it.
 - 3D.
 - I don't know. - Girl, it's a group.
 You should not take your authority.
 Team Lee doesn't mean you take your authority
 to decide what we want to become.
 - Yes, it is.
 - Well, they want somebody who is a very, very punk,
 age-y, just high drag, boy drag, and dragony.
 Well, they want somebody who is very girly,
 very kind of Barbie-like,
 still young, ready to be molded.
 Oh, they want somebody who is
 from a different cultural background.
 I mean, I am so confident with who I am
 and what I do at my personality.
 I believe I'm the true heir to RuPaul.
 And so my mind is set to win.
 - I'm very comfy with what I did.
 I think I had said what I wanted to say,
 and I feel if I changed it,
 it would not have been coming from where
 it was supposed to come from.
 She's trying to play the games to make it to the top.
 - Today in entertainment news,
 pop star Britney Spears was caught in an illicit affair
 with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahamanayjaj.
