 When I ran up to the envelope, I feel a cautious hand grabbed mind.
 I couldn't even like grab any of the envelopes.
 Is it a Viva glam challenge?
 I was excited.
 I grew up in the Philippines.
 That's-- OK.
 Yeah.
 So are you both mourning people, because you should be--
 We are now.
 You are now.
 Manly, but I'll fix it.
 It's natural for me to walk the runway.
 It's not natural for her, too.
 But because she got it so well, I'm really proud of that.
 Ba, ba, ba.
 Ru Paul, who's an amazing performer,
 is telling me that it's a little difficult going
 to get blamed if we lose, just because I'm team captain.
 And I swear to God, if I do, I'm going to cut someone.
 I think that when you get constructive criticism,
 if you start thinking about what you're going to say
 before you even listen to it, obviously you've not really
 listened to it.
 Gentlemen, Gorilla Kine.
 Let's look at your Viva glam screen test.
 I'm a Mac Viva glam woman, because like you and many others,
 I care.
 Mac's donates 100% of Viva glam proceeds to AIDS and HIV
 fun.
 Educate, donate, and celebrate, because life is a celebration.
 The two who met last year at a conference on nuclear--
 Look at me, me and I make a party.
 So as soon as she crosses off, no, no, back like just like this.
 Don't save it for me.
 Is this my inner Oprah wig?
 Oprah!
 How do you guys juggle your time between who's
 going to do the diaper, the bottles?
 So I never thought that I would actually
 get a chance to do this in my life.
 You're back here with me.
 How beautiful you are.
 When I saw RuPaul walk in, shivers just went down my spine.
 It was just seeing a superstar.
 Oh, enjoy it.
 The thing is, I went for the route of celebrating life
 and making sure that you always think positively,
 no matter what life throws at you.
 You have to appreciate what life has to offer.
 I mean, it's a really big deal.
 But you can't let that be a downer in your life.
 I'm the fastest diaper.
 I'm the fastest diaper changer I've ever done.
 You are.
 If there was contests, you would win that.
 Oh, 100%.
 Ooh.
 You can dry anything from your armpits
 to the back of your ear to the top of your head
 and anywhere else that you need to.
 You guys are fabulous.
 Whoa, I cannot believe this.
 That totally threw me by surprise.
 Not nice meat, not cold duck.
 Hey, did you guys come up with a name yet?
 We named our group serving fish.
 It was the best that we could come up with.
 We're about to rediscover.
 We'll wait here.
 I'm flexible.
 I don't usually wear wigs.
 That's the difference, too, between me and other drag wins.
 But last week, the judges told me
 that I looked like a boy in a dress.
 And I wanted to elevate that this week
 to not so much boy in a dress,
 but drag queen in a dress.
 I would throw myself under the bus
 'cause I was a team leader.
 It's actually really therapeutic for me to put on makeup.
 I really like the transition from a boy to a girl
 and becoming this person
 'cause I feel it's completely a different person
 from who I am.
 Oh, right, he's amazing.
 He's Sam.
 What are you saying?
 As always.
 Okay, really.
 I really wanted to wear short shorts.
 So I needed to make sure that I didn't have Mantle Toe,
 which is like the male version of a camel toe.
 I'm gonna have to put my balls behind my freaking body today.
 I don't really tuck as a drag queen.
 I try and avoid it just because it hurts.
 I'm Ryan.
 I know now.
 Let's do it again.
 They are really, really big.
 The mood in the workroom as the two teams are preparing
 is actually very separate.
 I think I forgot my pants today.
 I know.
 Yeah.
 There's no mirrors, you guys.
 Oh, I like the pair.
 No, I know I'm trying.
 My dress is dynamite.
 I knew exactly what I was going to do on the runway.
 And all the nervousness kind of went away the minute
 that I hit that plexiglass.
 I'm a Mac Viva Glam woman because like you and many others,
 I care.
 Mac donates 100% of the Viva Glam proceeds to the AIDS
 and HIV funds.
 Educate, donate, and celebrate.
 So I go to this.
 Hey, how are you?
 Hey, look at the room.
 Our tables are like pushing the--
 What?
 What do we need all this space for?
 Break dance?
 No, it all--
 Thank you so much.
 Let's see now, all nice to meet you.
 Hi, I'm China.
 Nice meeting you, nice to meet you.
 My middle name is Aung.
 And God didn't bless me with a certain Aina.
 Oh my god, you just asked so many questions at once.
 Yeah.
 What is up with no mirrors?
 Today, when we walked into the workroom,
 I noticed that the mirrors were blocked out.
 And it was scary.
 All right, you guys.
 Which is fine.
 I'll take it.
 I love it.
 But I wish I had immunity at the same time.
 Are you scared?
 I'll just run through it.
 When she first walked in today, I was like, holy Jesus,
 mother of Christ.
 She will beat and ass it and it might be mine.
 It goes on to my head.
 When I was on stage, all I know is that I hope they get it.
 I hope they get it.
 And I hope I get it because I can mess up, too.
 For me, it's like, I don't have any tips.
 I don't own a bra.
 Yeah.
 Is that hard?
 Gone with your outfit.
 These are lupas.
 So I unraveled them.
 And then I hand stitched them so that the ruffle would
 kind of be perfect.
 I want to, like, straighten your hair.
 Is that OK?
 I'm a math viva glam woman because, like you and many others,
 I care.
 OK, but I'll try it again.
 Oh, OK.
 Let's say you learn the lyrics and I'll take care of this.
 OK, OK.
 Finish the dress.
 Free cum dress.
 Totally.
 Yeah.
 I actually had a really big problem with that
 because I never usually talk.
 But I had the idea of wearing hot pants
 just because I like my booty cheeks.
 Right after the teleprompter, we have to pitch this product,
 make, you know, best channy win.
 Wow.
 I definitely think that at this point of the competition,
 getting so close to the end, that there is definite strategy
 on who she picked and she found strengths and weaknesses
 with each so that she can have an advantage.
 [LAUGHING]
 She's firing in the retires.
 She's going to be 92.
 It's kind of really scary.
 When you really don't know what's going to happen next,
 that's kind of nerve-wracking.
 And that totally, like, threw me by surprise.
 It is challenging to teach the way
 I walk the runway to another person.
 Just kind of walk around.
 Yeah, Peele always toes first.
 Do I look stupid?
 I was relieved to find out that Akasha was a team captain
 because I saw her lip sync performance,
 and it wasn't the best.
 And I really didn't want that in my group.
 On China.
 We're all kind of stressed out right now,
 trying to figure out exactly how this is going to come about.
 And we're really worried because we
 have really tough competition.
 For rehearsal time, I'm going to run through it once.
 In my group, I haven't delivered entire choreography,
 so we're all kind of stressed out right now.
 This is a dance.
 There's no need for me to go crazy and do curls and tumbles
 all over the stage.
 That's not who I am as a performer.
 It wasn't.
 Yes, oh my god, hi!
 I'm going to have a seat so I can tell you a little story of me.
 You don't need to really slow it down when you're showing it.
 Right.
 I'm going to throw that outside today.
 Run me through again the outfits that you're
 going to make for everyone.
 Yeah.
 Girls, how was it?
 That was probably the best challenge so far.
 You're a nice person.
 I got a whole--
 And I'm really excited to meet everyone else
 so that I can scope up the competition
 so that I know who I would be saying goodbye to
 on a weekly basis.
 So do you want big and awesome?
 I'm learning that you can't really judge a book by its cover
 because, like, Jared, she has a lot of feminine inside of her.
 You just need to, like, slap her around a little bit
 so we can do, like, that.
 And then, like, we can do a ponytail
 and that ponytail looks like your head piece.
 Like, this airplane.
 Hello.
 I was surprised for you.
 When you really don't know what's going to happen next,
 and that's nerve-rocking.
 Yeah.
 You look like a prom date.
 Yes, sir.
 Because it was a masculine feminine challenge.
 I wanted to be the more masculine one.
 It's not really a--
 Because it wanted me to be a little bit more feminine.
 Oh.
 You guys, seriously, somebody's going to get red
 and somebody's going to be set now.
 How's Tori's HIV?
 The easiest song.
 I can't even perform that song, let alone these butch girls,
 who probably have never even heard the song before.
 When I saw the car and the buckets of soap and the hoses,
 I just took over.
 Girls, are you ready for the fashion show?
 Oh, yes.
 For today's runway presentation, we
 are allowed to wear our own outfits.
 Oh, my god, what happened here?
 Tornado hit it.
 Today's elimination day.
 Someone is going home, and I'm really scared.
 Straight to work, girls, straight to work.
 Perchup does have the most experience,
 but sometimes experience doesn't really
 get you where you want to be.
 Just her really getting the persona of who I am.
 I want the entire angina to be this tomorrow.
 So I'm going to shave her hair tonight.
 I'm disappointed with myself, but at the same time,
 really happy with what has happened.
 I made it to the final five.
 I didn't make it to the final four,
 but angina is going to keep going.
 I'm not a drag queen that does imitation.
 I kind of have my own character inside
 that let's lose when I'm on stage performing.
 I was trying to help you.
 I buy a surprise.
 So it's just jet straight and pretty.
 No, but there are really strong competitors left and no mirror.
 I know her.
 My philosophy for dressing for the runway
 is that I want to give high glam kind of over the top,
 but still keeping it true to angina.
 So that's like part of my love.
 My biggest fear is that I will be in the bottom two
 and have to lip sync for my life.
 I won last week's challenge.
 And today, RuPaul said that there is no immunity.
 I just won this big fabulous prize.
 Educate, donate, and celebrate.
 Because life is a celebration.
 No, I forgot what your bicepness.
 And can you kneel, please?
 Well, as you know, I developed a really good friendship
 with Miss Nina Flowers.
 And I think she's fierce.
 All of them are fierce.
 But I think Nina Flowers is fierce.
 And I really want to see her take the crown home.
 But you guys were always saying how beautiful Rebecca Glasscock is.
 But you know beauty can only take you so far.
 That's right, jet shooting.
 And as far as Miss Beebe, you guys chose her over me.
 So at this point, I really don't know.
 It's going to take home the crown.
 But they're all fierce competitors.
 And I love you all.
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
 Amazing.
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
 Hi, five girl.
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
 Also known as ongina.
 Coming up.
 Today is elimination day.
 Someone is going home.
 Let's have a touch while working together.
 And so I think that that's probably the fairest game.
 It is a group competition.
 But at the same time, being judged separately,
 you have to consider the game.
 OK.
 I would like Miss Nina.
